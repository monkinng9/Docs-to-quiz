    "raw": "# Quiz Answers\n\nThis answer key provides detailed explanations for each quiz question, referencing relevant sections in the summary and study guide to reinforce learning objectives.  It also addresses common misconceptions and offers additional examples for deeper understanding.\n\n## Section 1: Flow Fundamentals (Basic Recall)\n\n1.  **What is the primary purpose of CrewAI Flows?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** The primary purpose of CrewAI Flows is to streamline the creation and management of complex AI workflows by connecting different tasks and Crews into a structured, event-driven system. This facilitates the development of sophisticated AI automations.\n\n    *   **Reasoning:** Flows offer an organized way to orchestrate the execution of multiple tasks, manage data flow between them, and handle state. (See Summary: Introduction to Flows, Study Guide: 1. CrewAI Flows: An Overview)\n\n    *   **Common Misconceptions:**  A common misconception is that Flows are limited to simple linear workflows.  Flows can handle complex branching, parallel execution, and dynamic routing.\n\n2.  **What are \"Crews\" in the context of CrewAI Flows?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** \"Crews\" are modular components or modules within a larger Flow. They encapsulate specific functionalities and can be reused across different Flows.\n\n    *   **Reasoning:**  Crews promote modularity and maintainability by breaking down complex workflows into smaller, manageable units. (See Summary: Integrating Crews, Study Guide: 5. Connecting Crews: Building Modular Workflows)\n\n    *   **Additional Example:**  A Crew could be responsible for sentiment analysis, another for language translation, and yet another for data extraction.  These Crews can then be combined within a Flow to perform a more complex task.\n\n3.  **Explain the difference between `@start()` and `@listen()` decorators.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**  `@start()` designates the starting point(s) of a Flow. Multiple methods can be decorated with `@start()`, enabling parallel execution at the beginning. `@listen()` connects methods, specifying that a method should execute *after* the completion of another method. The `@listen()` decorator takes the method it's listening to as an argument.\n\n    *   **Reasoning:** These decorators are fundamental for defining the execution flow within a Flow. (See Summary: Building Flows: Tasks and Decorators, Study Guide: 2. Workflow Creation with Decorators)\n\n    *   **Code Example:**\n        ```python\n        @start()\n        def task_a():\n            print(\"Task A started\")\n\n        @listen(task_a)\n        def task_b():\n            print(\"Task B started after Task A\")\n        ```\n\n4.  **What is the \"state\" within a Flow, and why is it important?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** The \"state\" is a shared data store within a Flow. It allows methods to access and modify data throughout the workflow's execution.\n\n    *   **Reasoning:**  State management is crucial for passing data between different tasks and maintaining consistency across the workflow.  (See Summary: Managing State, Study Guide: 3. State Management: Unstructured and Structured)\n\n    *   **Common Misconceptions:**  Confusing the Flow's state with local variables within a method.  The state is shared across the entire Flow, while local variables are only accessible within the method where they are defined.\n\n\n## Section 2: State Management and Flow Control (Applying Concepts)\n\n1.  **Describe the two main types of state management in CrewAI Flows and provide a simple code example for each.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**\n        *   **Unstructured State Management:** Allows flexible addition of attributes to the `state` object without a predefined schema.  This is convenient for simpler workflows but can lack type safety.\n\n            ```python\n            state.city = \"London\"\n            state.temperature = 20\n            ```\n\n        *   **Structured State Management:** Uses predefined schemas (e.g., Pydantic's `BaseModel`) to define the structure of the state. This provides type safety, validation, and better code maintainability.\n\n            ```python\n            from pydantic import BaseModel\n\n            class WeatherState(BaseModel):\n                city: str\n                temperature: int\n\n            state = WeatherState(city=\"London\", temperature=20)\n            ```\n\n    *   **Reasoning:** Understanding the different state management approaches allows you to choose the one that best suits your workflow's complexity and requirements. (See Summary: Managing State, Study Guide: 3. State Management: Unstructured and Structured)\n\n2.  **Explain the functionality of `or_` and `and_` in flow control. When would you use each?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**\n        *   **`or_`:** Triggers a listener method when *any* of the specified methods complete.  Use `or_` when you want a task to execute regardless of which of several preceding tasks finishes first.\n\n        *   **`and_`:** Triggers a listener method only when *all* of the specified methods complete. Use `and_` when a task depends on the completion of multiple preceding tasks.\n\n    *   **Reasoning:**  `or_` and `and_` provide fine-grained control over the execution flow based on dependencies between tasks. (See Summary: Controlling the Flow: Logic and Routing, Study Guide: 4. Flow Control: or_, and_, and @router())\n\n    *   **Example:**  In a data processing pipeline, you might use `or_` to trigger a logging task after either data cleaning or data transformation completes (since logging can happen after either). You would use `and_` to trigger a model training task only after *both* data cleaning and data transformation are finished.\n\n3.  **You have a method `validate_data` that checks the quality of incoming data. You want to execute `process_data` only if `validate_data` returns `True`. How would you implement this using `@router()`? Provide a code example.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**\n\n        ```python\n        @router(validate_data)\n        def route_data_processing(validation_result):\n            if validation_result:\n                return process_data\n\n        @listen(process_data) # Only triggered if validation_result is True\n        def post_processing():\n          print(\"Data processed successfully\")\n\n\n        @start()\n        def validate_data():\n            # ... data validation logic ...\n            return True  # or False based on validation\n\n        def process_data():\n           # ... data processing logic ...\n           print(\"Processing data...\")\n           return True\n\n        ```\n\n    *   **Reasoning:** `@router()` allows you to dynamically choose the next method to execute based on the output of the routed method. (See Summary: Controlling the Flow: Logic and Routing, Study Guide: 4. Flow Control: or_, and_, and @router())\n\n\n\n4.  **Imagine a scenario where you have three methods: `generate_ideas`, `refine_ideas`, and `finalize_ideas`. `refine_ideas` should run after `generate_ideas` completes. `finalize_ideas` should run only after *both* `generate_ideas` and `refine_ideas` are finished. Demonstrate how you would connect these methods using the appropriate decorators.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**\n\n        ```python\n        from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, and_, start\n\n        class IdeaFlow(Flow):\n\n            @start()\n            def generate_ideas(self):\n                # ... generate ideas logic ...\n                print(\"Ideas generated\")\n                return \"ideas\"\n\n            @listen(generate_ideas)\n            def refine_ideas(self, ideas):\n                # ... refine ideas logic ...\n                print(\"Ideas refined\")\n                return \"refined ideas\"\n\n            @listen(and_(generate_ideas, refine_ideas))\n            def finalize_ideas(self, ideas, refined_ideas):\n                # ... finalize ideas logic ...\n                print(\"Ideas finalized\")\n\n\n        ```\n\n    *   **Reasoning:**  `@listen()` ensures sequential execution, while `and_` ensures that `finalize_ideas` runs only after both preceding methods have completed.\n\n\n## Section 3: Integrating Crews and Visualization (Practical Application)\n\n1.  **Explain the purpose of the `crewai create flow <name>` command. Describe the resulting project structure.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**  The `crewai create flow <name>` command sets up a new CrewAI project specifically designed for flows.  It generates the necessary directory structure and files for organizing Crews and defining the flow logic.\n\n    *   **Project Structure:** (See Summary: Integrating Crews) The command creates a project directory with subdirectories for `crews` (containing individual Crew folders), `tools` (for custom tools), along with `main.py` (for the main flow definition), and configuration files. Each Crew directory further contains `config` (with `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` for Crew configuration) and a Python file for the Crew's implementation.\n\n2.  **How do you connect multiple Crews within a Flow? Which file is responsible for defining the Flow and the interactions between Crews?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**  Multiple Crews are connected within a Flow by instantiating them and calling their `crew().kickoff()` methods within the Flow's methods in `main.py`.  The `main.py` file is responsible for defining the overall Flow structure, connecting the Crews, and managing the flow of data between them.\n\n\n3.  **You have a complex Flow with multiple Crews and various conditional logic. How can you visualize this Flow to better understand its structure and execution path? Provide the command and/or method call.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** You can visualize a Flow by using the `plot()` method on a Flow instance: `flow.plot(\"flow_diagram\")`, or by using the command line: `crewai flow plot`.  This generates an interactive HTML file that visually represents the Flow's structure.\n\n    *   **Reasoning:** Visualizing complex Flows greatly aids in debugging, understanding execution paths, and communicating the workflow to others. (See Summary: Visualizing with Plots, Study Guide: 6. Visualizing Flows: Plotting for Clarity)\n\n4.  **Consider the \"Write a Book Flow\" example. Why is this a good example of chaining multiple Crews together? What is the benefit of this approach?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** The \"Write a Book Flow\" is a good example because it demonstrates how different Crews with specialized functionalities (e.g., outlining, chapter generation) can be chained together to perform a complex task.  This modular approach promotes reusability, maintainability, and allows for independent development and testing of each Crew.\n\n5.  **You want to build a Flow that monitors a social media feed for specific keywords.  When a keyword is detected, the Flow should trigger actions like sending a notification and logging the event. Which of the example Flows (Email Auto Responder, Lead Score, Write a Book, Meeting Assistant) is most similar to this scenario, and why?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** The **Meeting Assistant Flow** is the most similar.  It demonstrates how to \"broadcast\" a single event (in this case, the completion of a meeting) to trigger multiple follow-up actions.  Similarly, in the social media monitoring scenario, the detection of a keyword could be the event that triggers multiple actions like notification and logging.\n\n\n## Section 4: Advanced Scenarios (Critical Thinking)\n\n1.  **Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of unstructured versus structured state management. When would you choose one over the other?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**\n        *   **Unstructured State Management:**\n            *   **Advantages:** Flexibility, easy to add attributes on the fly.\n            *   **Disadvantages:**  Lack of type safety, potential for errors due to typos or inconsistent naming, harder to maintain in larger projects.\n\n        *   **Structured State Management:**\n            *   **Advantages:** Type safety, validation, improved code maintainability, auto-completion support in IDEs.\n            *   **Disadvantages:** Less flexible, requires defining a schema upfront.\n\n\n        *   **Choice:** Use unstructured state for simple, rapidly evolving workflows where flexibility is paramount. Choose structured state for complex workflows requiring maintainability, type safety, and where a well-defined schema is beneficial.\n\n\n2.  **How can you implement an infinite loop within a Flow? Which example Flow demonstrates this concept?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** An infinite loop can be implemented using a background task that continuously monitors for certain conditions or events. The **Email Auto Responder Flow** demonstrates this concept. It runs continuously in the background, checking for new emails and triggering automated responses.\n\n3.  **Explain the concept of \"broadcasting\" in the context of CrewAI Flows. Which example Flow showcases this feature? Provide a practical use case for broadcasting.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** \"Broadcasting\" refers to the ability of a single event within a Flow to trigger multiple subsequent actions or tasks. The **Meeting Assistant Flow** showcases this feature.  A practical use case is sending notifications to multiple channels (email, Slack, SMS) after a specific event occurs, like a new user signing up or a critical error being detected.\n\n4.  **You are designing a Flow for a customer support system. A customer submits a ticket, and the Flow needs to route the ticket to the appropriate department based on the ticket's category. How would you implement this routing logic using the concepts discussed in the study guide?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**  You would use the `@router()` decorator.  A method would analyze the ticket category and, based on the category, return the name of the method corresponding to the appropriate department.  The `@router()` would then direct the flow to that specific method.\n\n        ```python\n        @router(categorize_ticket)\n        def route_ticket(category):\n            if category == \"technical\":\n                return handle_technical_ticket\n            elif category == \"billing\":\n                return handle_billing_ticket\n            # ... other categories ...\n\n        def categorize_ticket(ticket):\n            # ... logic to extract ticket category ...\n            return \"technical\" # or \"billing\", etc.\n        ```\n\n5.  **What are some potential challenges you might encounter when working with Flows, and how would you address them? Consider factors like error handling, debugging, and maintaining complex workflows.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**\n        *   **Challenges:**\n            *   **Debugging complex Flows:** Use the `plot()` method to visualize the flow and identify bottlenecks or unexpected execution paths. Implement logging within each method to track the flow of data and identify errors.\n            *   **Error handling:** Implement `try-except` blocks within methods to handle potential errors gracefully and prevent the entire Flow from crashing.  Consider using a dedicated error handling Crew to centralize error management.\n            *   **Maintaining complex workflows:**  Use structured state management and well-defined Crew interfaces to improve code readability and maintainability.  Break down complex Flows into smaller, more manageable sub-flows if necessary.\n            *   **Circular dependencies:** Ensure that the flow logic does not create circular dependencies between methods, as this can lead to infinite loops or deadlocks.  Carefully plan the execution order using `@listen()` and flow control mechanisms.\n\n\nThis concludes the quiz answers.

Flows allow developers to combine and coordinate coding tasks and Crews efficiently, providing a robust framework for building sophisticated AI automations.\nFlows allow you to create structured, event-driven workflows. They provide a seamless way to connect multiple tasks, manage state, and control the flow of execution in your AI applications. With Flows, you can easily design and implement multi-step processes that leverage the full potential of CrewAI\u2019s capabilities.\n  1. **Simplified Workflow Creation** : Easily chain together multiple Crews and tasks to create complex AI workflows.\n  2. **State Management** : Flows make it super easy to manage and share state between different tasks in your workflow.\n  3. **Event-Driven Architecture** : Built on an event-driven model, allowing for dynamic and responsive workflows.\n  4. **Flexible Control Flow** : Implement conditional logic, loops, and branching within your workflows.\n\n\n## Getting Started\nLet\u2019s create a simple Flow where you will use OpenAI to generate a random city in one task and then use that city to generate a fun fact in another task.\n\n```python\n\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom litellm import completion\n\n\nclass ExampleFlow(Flow):\n    model = \"gpt-4o-mini\"\n\n    @start()\n    def generate_city(self):\n        print(\"Starting flow\")\n\n        response = completion(\n            model=self.model,\n            messages=[\n                {\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                    \"content\": \"Return the name of a random city in the world.\",\n                },\n            ],\n        )\n\n        random_city = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n        print(f\"Random City: {random_city}\")\n\n        return random_city\n\n    @listen(generate_city)\n    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):\n        response = completion(\n            model=self.model,\n            messages=[\n                {\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                    \"content\": f\"Tell me a fun fact about {random_city}\",\n                },\n            ],\n        )\n\n        fun_fact = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n        return fun_fact\n\n\n\nflow = ExampleFlow()\nresult = flow.kickoff()\n\nprint(f\"Generated fun fact: {result}\")\n```\n\nIn the above example, we have created a simple Flow that generates a random city using OpenAI and then generates a fun fact about that city. The Flow consists of two tasks: `generate_city` and `generate_fun_fact`. The `generate_city` task is the starting point of the Flow, and the `generate_fun_fact` task listens for the output of the `generate_city` task.\nWhen you run the Flow, it will generate a random city and then generate a fun fact about that city. The output will be printed to the console.\n**Note:** Ensure you have set up your `.env` file to store your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. This key is necessary for authenticating requests to the OpenAI API.\n\n### @start()\nThe `@start()` decorator is used to mark a method as the starting point of a Flow. When a Flow is started, all the methods decorated with `@start()` are executed in parallel. You can have multiple start methods in a Flow, and they will all be executed when the Flow is started.\n### @listen()\n\nThe `@listen()` decorator is used to mark a method as a listener for the output of another task in the Flow. The method decorated with `@listen()` will be executed when the specified task emits an output. The method can access the output of the task it is listening to as an argument.\n\n#### Usage\nThe `@listen()` decorator can be used in several ways:\n  1. **Listening to a Method by Name** : You can pass the name of the method you want to listen to as a string. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.\n    ```python\n    @listen(\"generate_city\")\n    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):\n    # Implementation\n\n    ```\n\n  2. **Listening to a Method Directly** : You can pass the method itself. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.\n    ```python\n    @listen(generate_city)\n    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):\n    # Implementation\n\n    ```\n\n### Flow Output\nAccessing and handling the output of a Flow is essential for integrating your AI workflows into larger applications or systems. CrewAI Flows provide straightforward mechanisms to retrieve the final output, access intermediate results, and manage the overall state of your Flow.\n\n#### Retrieving the Final Output\nWhen you run a Flow, the final output is determined by the last method that completes. The `kickoff()` method returns the output of this final method.\nHere\u2019s how you can access the final output:\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nclass OutputExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    return \"Output from first_method\"\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self, first_output):\n    return f\"Second method received: {first_output}\"\n\nflow = OutputExampleFlow()\nfinal_output = flow.kickoff()\nprint(\"---- Final Output ----\")\nprint(final_output)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `second_method` is the last method to complete, so its output will be the final output of the Flow. The `kickoff()` method will return the final output, which is then printed to the console.\n\n#### Accessing and Updating State\nIn addition to retrieving the final output, you can also access and update the state within your Flow. The state can be used to store and share data between different methods in the Flow. After the Flow has run, you can access the state to retrieve any information that was added or updated during the execution.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how to update and access the state:\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nclass ExampleState(BaseModel):\n  counter: int = 0\n  message: str = \"\"\nclass StateExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    self.state.message = \"Hello from first_method\"\n    self.state.counter += 1\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state.message += \" - updated by second_method\"\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    return self.state.message\nflow = StateExampleFlow()\nfinal_output = flow.kickoff()\nprint(f\"Final Output: {final_output}\")\nprint(\"Final State:\")\nprint(flow.state)\n```\n\nIn this example, the state is updated by both `first_method` and `second_method`. After the Flow has run, you can access the final state to see the updates made by these methods.\nBy ensuring that the final method\u2019s output is returned and providing access to the state, CrewAI Flows make it easy to integrate the results of your AI workflows into larger applications or systems, while also maintaining and accessing the state throughout the Flow\u2019s execution.\n\n## Flow State Management\nManaging state effectively is crucial for building reliable and maintainable AI workflows. CrewAI Flows provides robust mechanisms for both unstructured and structured state management, allowing developers to choose the approach that best fits their application\u2019s needs.\n\n### Unstructured State Management\nIn unstructured state management, all state is stored in the `state` attribute of the `Flow` class. This approach offers flexibility, enabling developers to add or modify state attributes on the fly without defining a strict schema.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nclass UntructuredExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    self.state.message = \"Hello from structured flow\"\n    self.state.counter = 0\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated\"\n  @listen(second_method)\n  def third_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated again\"\n    print(f\"State after third_method: {self.state}\")\n\nflow = UntructuredExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n  * **Flexibility:** You can dynamically add attributes to `self.state` without predefined constraints.\n  * **Simplicity:** Ideal for straightforward workflows where state structure is minimal or varies significantly.\n\n### Structured State Management\nStructured state management leverages predefined schemas to ensure consistency and type safety across the workflow. By using models like Pydantic\u2019s `BaseModel`, developers can define the exact shape of the state, enabling better validation and auto-completion in development environments.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass ExampleState(BaseModel):\n  counter: int = 0\n  message: str = \"\"\n\nclass StructuredExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    self.state.message = \"Hello from structured flow\"\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated\"\n  @listen(second_method)\n  def third_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated again\"\n    print(f\"State after third_method: {self.state}\")\n\nflow = StructuredExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n  * **Defined Schema:** `ExampleState` clearly outlines the state structure, enhancing code readability and maintainability.\n  * **Type Safety:** Leveraging Pydantic ensures that state attributes adhere to the specified types, reducing runtime errors.\n  * **Auto-Completion:** IDEs can provide better auto-completion and error checking based on the defined state model.\n\n\n### Choosing Between Unstructured and Structured State Management\n  * **Use Unstructured State Management when:**\n    * The workflow\u2019s state is simple or highly dynamic.\n    * Flexibility is prioritized over strict state definitions.\n    * Rapid prototyping is required without the overhead of defining schemas.\n  * **Use Structured State Management when:**\n    * The workflow requires a well-defined and consistent state structure.\n    * Type safety and validation are important for your application\u2019s reliability.\n    * You want to leverage IDE features like auto-completion and type checking for better developer experience.\n\n\nBy providing both unstructured and structured state management options, CrewAI Flows empowers developers to build AI workflows that are both flexible and robust, catering to a wide range of application requirements.\n\n## Flow Control\n\n### Conditional Logic: `or`\nThe `or_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, or_, start\nclass OrExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def start_method(self):\n    return \"Hello from the start method\"\n  @listen(start_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    return \"Hello from the second method\"\n  @listen(or_(start_method, second_method))\n  def logger(self, result):\n    print(f\"Logger: {result}\")\n\nflow = OrExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n```\n\nWhen you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered by the output of either the `start_method` or the `second_method`. The `or_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.\n\n### Conditional Logic: `and`\nThe `and_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, and_, listen, start\nclass AndExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def start_method(self):\n    self.state[\"greeting\"] = \"Hello from the start method\"\n  @listen(start_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state[\"joke\"] = \"What do computers eat? Microchips.\"\n  @listen(and_(start_method, second_method))\n  def logger(self):\n    print(\"---- Logger ----\")\n    print(self.state)\nflow = AndExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n```\n\nWhen you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered only when both the `start_method` and the `second_method` emit an output. The `and_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.\n### Router\nThe `@router()` decorator in Flows allows you to define conditional routing logic based on the output of a method. You can specify different routes based on the output of the method, allowing you to control the flow of execution dynamically.\n\n\n```python\nimport random\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, router, start\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nclass ExampleState(BaseModel):\n  success_flag: bool = False\nclass RouterFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):\n  @start()\n  def start_method(self):\n    print(\"Starting the structured flow\")\n    random_boolean = random.choice([True, False])\n    self.state.success_flag = random_boolean\n  @router(start_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    if self.state.success_flag:\n      return \"success\"\n    else:\n      return \"failed\"\n  @listen(\"success\")\n  def third_method(self):\n    print(\"Third method running\")\n  @listen(\"failed\")\n  def fourth_method(self):\n    print(\"Fourth method running\")\n\nflow = RouterFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `start_method` generates a random boolean value and sets it in the state. The `second_method` uses the `@router()` decorator to define conditional routing logic based on the value of the boolean. If the boolean is `True`, the method returns `\"success\"`, and if it is `False`, the method returns `\"failed\"`. The `third_method` and `fourth_method` listen to the output of the `second_method` and execute based on the returned value.\nWhen you run this Flow, the output will change based on the random boolean value generated by the `start_method`.\n\n## Adding Crews to Flows\nCreating a flow with multiple crews in CrewAI is straightforward.\nYou can generate a new CrewAI project that includes all the scaffolding needed to create a flow with multiple crews by running the following command:\n\n```bash\ncrewai create flow name_of_flow\n```\n\nThis command will generate a new CrewAI project with the necessary folder structure. The generated project includes a prebuilt crew called `poem_crew` that is already working. You can use this crew as a template by copying, pasting, and editing it to create other crews.\n\n### Folder Structure\nAfter running the `crewai create flow name_of_flow` command, you will see a folder structure similar to the following:\nDirectory/File| Description  \n---|---  \n`name_of_flow/`| Root directory for the flow.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `crews/`| Contains directories for specific crews.  \n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 `poem_crew/`| Directory for the \u201cpoem_crew\u201d with its configurations and scripts.  \n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 `config/`| Configuration files directory for the \u201cpoem_crew\u201d.  \n\u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 `agents.yaml`| YAML file defining the agents for \u201cpoem_crew\u201d.  \n\u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 `tasks.yaml`| YAML file defining the tasks for \u201cpoem_crew\u201d.  \n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 `poem_crew.py`| Script for \u201cpoem_crew\u201d functionality.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `tools/`| Directory for additional tools used in the flow.  \n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 `custom_tool.py`| Custom tool implementation.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `main.py`| Main script for running the flow.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `README.md`| Project description and instructions.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `pyproject.toml`| Configuration file for project dependencies and settings.  \n\u2514\u2500\u2500 `.gitignore`| Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control.  \n\n### Building Your Crews\nIn the `crews` folder, you can define multiple crews. Each crew will have its own folder containing configuration files and the crew definition file. For example, the `poem_crew` folder contains:\n  * `config/agents.yaml`: Defines the agents for the crew.\n  * `config/tasks.yaml`: Defines the tasks for the crew.\n  * `poem_crew.py`: Contains the crew definition, including agents, tasks, and the crew itself.\n\nYou can copy, paste, and edit the `poem_crew` to create other crews.\n\n### Connecting Crews in `main.py`\nThe `main.py` file is where you create your flow and connect the crews together. You can define your flow by using the `Flow` class and the decorators `@start` and `@listen` to specify the flow of execution.\nHere\u2019s an example of how you can connect the `poem_crew` in the `main.py` file:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nfrom random import randint\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom .crews.poem_crew.poem_crew import PoemCrew\nclass PoemState(BaseModel):\n  sentence_count: int = 1\n  poem: str = \"\"\nclass PoemFlow(Flow[PoemState]):\n  @start()\n  def generate_sentence_count(self):\n    print(\"Generating sentence count\")\n    self.state.sentence_count = randint(1, 5)\n  @listen(generate_sentence_count)\n  def generate_poem(self):\n    print(\"Generating poem\")\n    result = PoemCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs={\"sentence_count\": self.state.sentence_count})\n    print(\"Poem generated\", result.raw)\n    self.state.poem = result.raw\n  @listen(generate_poem)\n  def save_poem(self):\n    print(\"Saving poem\")\n    with open(\"poem.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n      f.write(self.state.poem)\ndef kickoff():\n  poem_flow = PoemFlow()\n  poem_flow.kickoff()\n\ndef plot():\n  poem_flow = PoemFlow()\n  poem_flow.plot()\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  kickoff()\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the `PoemFlow` class defines a flow that generates a sentence count, uses the `PoemCrew` to generate a poem, and then saves the poem to a file. The flow is kicked off by calling the `kickoff()` method.\n\n### Running the Flow\n(Optional) Before running the flow, you can install the dependencies by running:\n\n```bash\ncrewai install\n```\n\nOnce all of the dependencies are installed, you need to activate the virtual environment by running:\n```bash\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nAfter activating the virtual environment, you can run the flow by executing one of the following commands:\n```bash\ncrewai flow kickoff\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nuv run kickoff\n\n```\n\nThe flow will execute, and you should see the output in the console.\n\n## Plot Flows\nVisualizing your AI workflows can provide valuable insights into the structure and execution paths of your flows. CrewAI offers a powerful visualization tool that allows you to generate interactive plots of your flows, making it easier to understand and optimize your AI workflows.\n\n### What are Plots?\nPlots in CrewAI are graphical representations of your AI workflows. They display the various tasks, their connections, and the flow of data between them. This visualization helps in understanding the sequence of operations, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring that the workflow logic aligns with your expectations.\n### How to Generate a Plot\n\nCrewAI provides two convenient methods to generate plots of your flows:\n#### Option 1: Using the `plot()` Method\nIf you are working directly with a flow instance, you can generate a plot by calling the `plot()` method on your flow object. This method will create an HTML file containing the interactive plot of your flow.\n\n```python\n# Assuming you have a flow instance\nflow.plot(\"my_flow_plot\")\n\n```\n\nThis will generate a file named `my_flow_plot.html` in your current directory. You can open this file in a web browser to view the interactive plot.\n#### Option 2: Using the Command Line\nIf you are working within a structured CrewAI project, you can generate a plot using the command line. This is particularly useful for larger projects where you want to visualize the entire flow setup.\n\n```bash\ncrewai flow plot\n```\n\nThis command will generate an HTML file with the plot of your flow, similar to the `plot()` method. The file will be saved in your project directory, and you can open it in a web browser to explore the flow.\n\n### Understanding the Plot\nThe generated plot will display nodes representing the tasks in your flow, with directed edges indicating the flow of execution. The plot is interactive, allowing you to zoom in and out, and hover over nodes to see additional details.\nBy visualizing your flows, you can gain a clearer understanding of the workflow\u2019s structure, making it easier to debug, optimize, and communicate your AI processes to others.\n\n### Conclusion\nPlotting your flows is a powerful feature of CrewAI that enhances your ability to design and manage complex AI workflows. Whether you choose to use the `plot()` method or the command line, generating plots will provide you with a visual representation of your workflows, aiding in both development and presentation.\n\n## Next Steps\nIf you\u2019re interested in exploring additional examples of flows, we have a variety of recommendations in our examples repository. Here are four specific flow examples, each showcasing unique use cases to help you match your current problem type to a specific example:\n  1. **Email Auto Responder Flow** : This example demonstrates an infinite loop where a background job continually runs to automate email responses. It\u2019s a great use case for tasks that need to be performed repeatedly without manual intervention. View Example\n  2. **Lead Score Flow** : This flow showcases adding human-in-the-loop feedback and handling different conditional branches using the router. It\u2019s an excellent example of how to incorporate dynamic decision-making and human oversight into your workflows. View Example\n  3. **Write a Book Flow** : This example excels at chaining multiple crews together, where the output of one crew is used by another. Specifically, one crew outlines an entire book, and another crew generates chapters based on the outline. Eventually, everything is connected to produce a complete book. This flow is perfect for complex, multi-step processes that require coordination between different tasks. View Example\n  4. **Meeting Assistant Flow** : This flow demonstrates how to broadcast one event to trigger multiple follow-up actions. For instance, after a meeting is completed, the flow can update a Trello board, send a Slack message, and save the results. It\u2019s a great example of handling multiple outcomes from a single event, making it ideal for comprehensive task management and notification systems. View Example\n\nPlease extract:\n1.

Flows allow developers to combine and coordinate coding tasks and Crews efficiently, providing a robust framework for building sophisticated AI automations.\nFlows allow you to create structured, event-driven workflows. They provide a seamless way to connect multiple tasks, manage state, and control the flow of execution in your AI applications. With Flows, you can easily design and implement multi-step processes that leverage the full potential of CrewAI\u2019s capabilities.\n  1. **Simplified Workflow Creation** : Easily chain together multiple Crews and tasks to create complex AI workflows.\n  2. **State Management** : Flows make it super easy to manage and share state between different tasks in your workflow.\n  3. **Event-Driven Architecture** : Built on an event-driven model, allowing for dynamic and responsive workflows.\n  4. **Flexible Control Flow** : Implement conditional logic, loops, and branching within your workflows.\n\n\n## Getting Started\nLet\u2019s create a simple Flow where you will use OpenAI to generate a random city in one task and then use that city to generate a fun fact in another task.\n\n```python\n\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom litellm import completion\n\n\nclass ExampleFlow(Flow):\n    model = \"gpt-4o-mini\"\n\n    @start()\n    def generate_city(self):\n        print(\"Starting flow\")\n\n        response = completion(\n            model=self.model,\n            messages=[\n                {\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                    \"content\": \"Return the name of a random city in the world.\",\n                },\n            ],\n        )\n\n        random_city = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n        print(f\"Random City: {random_city}\")\n\n        return random_city\n\n    @listen(generate_city)\n    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):\n        response = completion(\n            model=self.model,\n            messages=[\n                {\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                    \"content\": f\"Tell me a fun fact about {random_city}\",\n                },\n            ],\n        )\n\n        fun_fact = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n        return fun_fact\n\n\n\nflow = ExampleFlow()\nresult = flow.kickoff()\n\nprint(f\"Generated fun fact: {result}\")\n```\n\nIn the above example, we have created a simple Flow that generates a random city using OpenAI and then generates a fun fact about that city. The Flow consists of two tasks: `generate_city` and `generate_fun_fact`. The `generate_city` task is the starting point of the Flow, and the `generate_fun_fact` task listens for the output of the `generate_city` task.\nWhen you run the Flow, it will generate a random city and then generate a fun fact about that city. The output will be printed to the console.\n**Note:** Ensure you have set up your `.env` file to store your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. This key is necessary for authenticating requests to the OpenAI API.\n\n### @start()\nThe `@start()` decorator is used to mark a method as the starting point of a Flow. When a Flow is started, all the methods decorated with `@start()` are executed in parallel. You can have multiple start methods in a Flow, and they will all be executed when the Flow is started.\n### @listen()\n\nThe `@listen()` decorator is used to mark a method as a listener for the output of another task in the Flow. The method decorated with `@listen()` will be executed when the specified task emits an output. The method can access the output of the task it is listening to as an argument.\n\n#### Usage\nThe `@listen()` decorator can be used in several ways:\n  1. **Listening to a Method by Name** : You can pass the name of the method you want to listen to as a string. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.\n    ```python\n    @listen(\"generate_city\")\n    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):\n    # Implementation\n\n    ```\n\n  2. **Listening to a Method Directly** : You can pass the method itself. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.\n    ```python\n    @listen(generate_city)\n    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):\n    # Implementation\n\n    ```\n\n### Flow Output\nAccessing and handling the output of a Flow is essential for integrating your AI workflows into larger applications or systems. CrewAI Flows provide straightforward mechanisms to retrieve the final output, access intermediate results, and manage the overall state of your Flow.\n\n#### Retrieving the Final Output\nWhen you run a Flow, the final output is determined by the last method that completes. The `kickoff()` method returns the output of this final method.\nHere\u2019s how you can access the final output:\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nclass OutputExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    return \"Output from first_method\"\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self, first_output):\n    return f\"Second method received: {first_output}\"\n\nflow = OutputExampleFlow()\nfinal_output = flow.kickoff()\nprint(\"---- Final Output ----\")\nprint(final_output)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `second_method` is the last method to complete, so its output will be the final output of the Flow. The `kickoff()` method will return the final output, which is then printed to the console.\n\n#### Accessing and Updating State\nIn addition to retrieving the final output, you can also access and update the state within your Flow. The state can be used to store and share data between different methods in the Flow. After the Flow has run, you can access the state to retrieve any information that was added or updated during the execution.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how to update and access the state:\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nclass ExampleState(BaseModel):\n  counter: int = 0\n  message: str = \"\"\nclass StateExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    self.state.message = \"Hello from first_method\"\n    self.state.counter += 1\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state.message += \" - updated by second_method\"\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    return self.state.message\nflow = StateExampleFlow()\nfinal_output = flow.kickoff()\nprint(f\"Final Output: {final_output}\")\nprint(\"Final State:\")\nprint(flow.state)\n```\n\nIn this example, the state is updated by both `first_method` and `second_method`. After the Flow has run, you can access the final state to see the updates made by these methods.\nBy ensuring that the final method\u2019s output is returned and providing access to the state, CrewAI Flows make it easy to integrate the results of your AI workflows into larger applications or systems, while also maintaining and accessing the state throughout the Flow\u2019s execution.\n\n## Flow State Management\nManaging state effectively is crucial for building reliable and maintainable AI workflows. CrewAI Flows provides robust mechanisms for both unstructured and structured state management, allowing developers to choose the approach that best fits their application\u2019s needs.\n\n### Unstructured State Management\nIn unstructured state management, all state is stored in the `state` attribute of the `Flow` class. This approach offers flexibility, enabling developers to add or modify state attributes on the fly without defining a strict schema.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nclass UntructuredExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    self.state.message = \"Hello from structured flow\"\n    self.state.counter = 0\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated\"\n  @listen(second_method)\n  def third_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated again\"\n    print(f\"State after third_method: {self.state}\")\n\nflow = UntructuredExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n  * **Flexibility:** You can dynamically add attributes to `self.state` without predefined constraints.\n  * **Simplicity:** Ideal for straightforward workflows where state structure is minimal or varies significantly.\n\n### Structured State Management\nStructured state management leverages predefined schemas to ensure consistency and type safety across the workflow. By using models like Pydantic\u2019s `BaseModel`, developers can define the exact shape of the state, enabling better validation and auto-completion in development environments.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass ExampleState(BaseModel):\n  counter: int = 0\n  message: str = \"\"\n\nclass StructuredExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    self.state.message = \"Hello from structured flow\"\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated\"\n  @listen(second_method)\n  def third_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated again\"\n    print(f\"State after third_method: {self.state}\")\n\nflow = StructuredExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n  * **Defined Schema:** `ExampleState` clearly outlines the state structure, enhancing code readability and maintainability.\n  * **Type Safety:** Leveraging Pydantic ensures that state attributes adhere to the specified types, reducing runtime errors.\n  * **Auto-Completion:** IDEs can provide better auto-completion and error checking based on the defined state model.\n\n\n### Choosing Between Unstructured and Structured State Management\n  * **Use Unstructured State Management when:**\n    * The workflow\u2019s state is simple or highly dynamic.\n    * Flexibility is prioritized over strict state definitions.\n    * Rapid prototyping is required without the overhead of defining schemas.\n  * **Use Structured State Management when:**\n    * The workflow requires a well-defined and consistent state structure.\n    * Type safety and validation are important for your application\u2019s reliability.\n    * You want to leverage IDE features like auto-completion and type checking for better developer experience.\n\n\nBy providing both unstructured and structured state management options, CrewAI Flows empowers developers to build AI workflows that are both flexible and robust, catering to a wide range of application requirements.\n\n## Flow Control\n\n### Conditional Logic: `or`\nThe `or_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, or_, start\nclass OrExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def start_method(self):\n    return \"Hello from the start method\"\n  @listen(start_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    return \"Hello from the second method\"\n  @listen(or_(start_method, second_method))\n  def logger(self, result):\n    print(f\"Logger: {result}\")\n\nflow = OrExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n```\n\nWhen you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered by the output of either the `start_method` or the `second_method`. The `or_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.\n\n### Conditional Logic: `and`\nThe `and_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, and_, listen, start\nclass AndExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def start_method(self):\n    self.state[\"greeting\"] = \"Hello from the start method\"\n  @listen(start_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state[\"joke\"] = \"What do computers eat? Microchips.\"\n  @listen(and_(start_method, second_method))\n  def logger(self):\n    print(\"---- Logger ----\")\n    print(self.state)\nflow = AndExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n```\n\nWhen you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered only when both the `start_method` and the `second_method` emit an output. The `and_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.\n### Router\nThe `@router()` decorator in Flows allows you to define conditional routing logic based on the output of a method. You can specify different routes based on the output of the method, allowing you to control the flow of execution dynamically.\n\n\n```python\nimport random\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, router, start\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nclass ExampleState(BaseModel):\n  success_flag: bool = False\nclass RouterFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):\n  @start()\n  def start_method(self):\n    print(\"Starting the structured flow\")\n    random_boolean = random.choice([True, False])\n    self.state.success_flag = random_boolean\n  @router(start_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    if self.state.success_flag:\n      return \"success\"\n    else:\n      return \"failed\"\n  @listen(\"success\")\n  def third_method(self):\n    print(\"Third method running\")\n  @listen(\"failed\")\n  def fourth_method(self):\n    print(\"Fourth method running\")\n\nflow = RouterFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `start_method` generates a random boolean value and sets it in the state. The `second_method` uses the `@router()` decorator to define conditional routing logic based on the value of the boolean. If the boolean is `True`, the method returns `\"success\"`, and if it is `False`, the method returns `\"failed\"`. The `third_method` and `fourth_method` listen to the output of the `second_method` and execute based on the returned value.\nWhen you run this Flow, the output will change based on the random boolean value generated by the `start_method`.\n\n## Adding Crews to Flows\nCreating a flow with multiple crews in CrewAI is straightforward.\nYou can generate a new CrewAI project that includes all the scaffolding needed to create a flow with multiple crews by running the following command:\n\n```bash\ncrewai create flow name_of_flow\n```\n\nThis command will generate a new CrewAI project with the necessary folder structure. The generated project includes a prebuilt crew called `poem_crew` that is already working. You can use this crew as a template by copying, pasting, and editing it to create other crews.\n\n### Folder Structure\nAfter running the `crewai create flow name_of_flow` command, you will see a folder structure similar to the following:\nDirectory/File| Description  \n---|---  \n`name_of_flow/`| Root directory for the flow.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `crews/`| Contains directories for specific crews.  \n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 `poem_crew/`| Directory for the \u201cpoem_crew\u201d with its configurations and scripts.  \n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 `config/`| Configuration files directory for the \u201cpoem_crew\u201d.  \n\u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 `agents.yaml`| YAML file defining the agents for \u201cpoem_crew\u201d.  \n\u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 `tasks.yaml`| YAML file defining the tasks for \u201cpoem_crew\u201d.  \n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 `poem_crew.py`| Script for \u201cpoem_crew\u201d functionality.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `tools/`| Directory for additional tools used in the flow.  \n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 `custom_tool.py`| Custom tool implementation.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `main.py`| Main script for running the flow.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `README.md`| Project description and instructions.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `pyproject.toml`| Configuration file for project dependencies and settings.  \n\u2514\u2500\u2500 `.gitignore`| Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control.  \n\n### Building Your Crews\nIn the `crews` folder, you can define multiple crews. Each crew will have its own folder containing configuration files and the crew definition file. For example, the `poem_crew` folder contains:\n  * `config/agents.yaml`: Defines the agents for the crew.\n  * `config/tasks.yaml`: Defines the tasks for the crew.\n  * `poem_crew.py`: Contains the crew definition, including agents, tasks, and the crew itself.\n\nYou can copy, paste, and edit the `poem_crew` to create other crews.\n\n### Connecting Crews in `main.py`\nThe `main.py` file is where you create your flow and connect the crews together. You can define your flow by using the `Flow` class and the decorators `@start` and `@listen` to specify the flow of execution.\nHere\u2019s an example of how you can connect the `poem_crew` in the `main.py` file:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nfrom random import randint\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom .crews.poem_crew.poem_crew import PoemCrew\nclass PoemState(BaseModel):\n  sentence_count: int = 1\n  poem: str = \"\"\nclass PoemFlow(Flow[PoemState]):\n  @start()\n  def generate_sentence_count(self):\n    print(\"Generating sentence count\")\n    self.state.sentence_count = randint(1, 5)\n  @listen(generate_sentence_count)\n  def generate_poem(self):\n    print(\"Generating poem\")\n    result = PoemCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs={\"sentence_count\": self.state.sentence_count})\n    print(\"Poem generated\", result.raw)\n    self.state.poem = result.raw\n  @listen(generate_poem)\n  def save_poem(self):\n    print(\"Saving poem\")\n    with open(\"poem.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n      f.write(self.state.poem)\ndef kickoff():\n  poem_flow = PoemFlow()\n  poem_flow.kickoff()\n\ndef plot():\n  poem_flow = PoemFlow()\n  poem_flow.plot()\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  kickoff()\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the `PoemFlow` class defines a flow that generates a sentence count, uses the `PoemCrew` to generate a poem, and then saves the poem to a file. The flow is kicked off by calling the `kickoff()` method.\n\n### Running the Flow\n(Optional) Before running the flow, you can install the dependencies by running:\n\n```bash\ncrewai install\n```\n\nOnce all of the dependencies are installed, you need to activate the virtual environment by running:\n```bash\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nAfter activating the virtual environment, you can run the flow by executing one of the following commands:\n```bash\ncrewai flow kickoff\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nuv run kickoff\n\n```\n\nThe flow will execute, and you should see the output in the console.\n\n## Plot Flows\nVisualizing your AI workflows can provide valuable insights into the structure and execution paths of your flows. CrewAI offers a powerful visualization tool that allows you to generate interactive plots of your flows, making it easier to understand and optimize your AI workflows.\n\n### What are Plots?\nPlots in CrewAI are graphical representations of your AI workflows. They display the various tasks, their connections, and the flow of data between them. This visualization helps in understanding the sequence of operations, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring that the workflow logic aligns with your expectations.\n### How to Generate a Plot\n\nCrewAI provides two convenient methods to generate plots of your flows:\n#### Option 1: Using the `plot()` Method\nIf you are working directly with a flow instance, you can generate a plot by calling the `plot()` method on your flow object. This method will create an HTML file containing the interactive plot of your flow.\n\n```python\n# Assuming you have a flow instance\nflow.plot(\"my_flow_plot\")\n\n```\n\nThis will generate a file named `my_flow_plot.html` in your current directory. You can open this file in a web browser to view the interactive plot.\n#### Option 2: Using the Command Line\nIf you are working within a structured CrewAI project, you can generate a plot using the command line. This is particularly useful for larger projects where you want to visualize the entire flow setup.\n\n```bash\ncrewai flow plot\n```\n\nThis command will generate an HTML file with the plot of your flow, similar to the `plot()` method. The file will be saved in your project directory, and you can open it in a web browser to explore the flow.\n\n### Understanding the Plot\nThe generated plot will display nodes representing the tasks in your flow, with directed edges indicating the flow of execution. The plot is interactive, allowing you to zoom in and out, and hover over nodes to see additional details.\nBy visualizing your flows, you can gain a clearer understanding of the workflow\u2019s structure, making it easier to debug, optimize, and communicate your AI processes to others.\n\n### Conclusion\nPlotting your flows is a powerful feature of CrewAI that enhances your ability to design and manage complex AI workflows. Whether you choose to use the `plot()` method or the command line, generating plots will provide you with a visual representation of your workflows, aiding in both development and presentation.\n\n## Next Steps\nIf you\u2019re interested in exploring additional examples of flows, we have a variety of recommendations in our examples repository. Here are four specific flow examples, each showcasing unique use cases to help you match your current problem type to a specific example:\n  1. **Email Auto Responder Flow** : This example demonstrates an infinite loop where a background job continually runs to automate email responses. It\u2019s a great use case for tasks that need to be performed repeatedly without manual intervention. View Example\n  2. **Lead Score Flow** : This flow showcases adding human-in-the-loop feedback and handling different conditional branches using the router. It\u2019s an excellent example of how to incorporate dynamic decision-making and human oversight into your workflows. View Example\n  3. **Write a Book Flow** : This example excels at chaining multiple crews together, where the output of one crew is used by another. Specifically, one crew outlines an entire book, and another crew generates chapters based on the outline. Eventually, everything is connected to produce a complete book. This flow is perfect for complex, multi-step processes that require coordination between different tasks. View Example\n  4. **Meeting Assistant Flow** : This flow demonstrates how to broadcast one event to trigger multiple follow-up actions. For instance, after a meeting is completed, the flow can update a Trello board, send a Slack message, and save the results. It\u2019s a great example of handling multiple outcomes from a single event, making it ideal for comprehensive task management and notification systems.

They streamline the process of connecting various tasks and \"Crews\" (modular components within a flow) into a structured, event-driven system. This architecture allows for sophisticated AI automation, enabling developers to build dynamic and responsive applications.  Flows handle the intricacies of state management, ensuring data consistency across different tasks, and provide flexible control flow mechanisms for handling various scenarios.\n\nBy the end of this summary, you should be able to:\n\n*   **Define** a CrewAI Flow and its purpose.\n*   **Create** a simple Flow using `@start()` and `@listen()` decorators.\n*   **Implement** state management within a Flow.\n*   **Utilize** `or_`, `and_`, and `@router()` for flow control.\n*   **Connect** multiple Crews within a Flow.\n*   **Visualize** Flows using the plotting functionality.\n\n## Introduction to Flows\n\nCrewAI Flows simplify the creation of complex workflows by linking together different tasks and Crews. They provide an organized structure, managing the execution sequence and data flow between components.  Flows are event-driven, meaning they react dynamically to the completion of tasks, triggering subsequent actions based on predefined logic. This approach allows for flexible and responsive workflows, capable of handling various scenarios and conditional executions.  Key features include simplified workflow creation, state management, an event-driven architecture, and flexible control flow.\n\n## Building Flows: Tasks and Decorators\n\nCreating a Flow involves defining individual tasks and connecting them using special decorators. The `@start()` decorator designates the starting point(s) of a Flow. Multiple methods can be marked with `@start()`, allowing them to execute in parallel at the beginning of the workflow. The `@listen()` decorator links methods together. A method decorated with `@listen()` will execute after the method it's listening to completes. For example, `@listen(generate_city)` means the decorated method will run after the `generate_city` method finishes, receiving its output as an argument.\n\n## Managing State\n\nFlows provide mechanisms for managing the \"state,\" which is data shared between different methods.  This allows information to be passed and modified throughout the workflow.  Flows support both *unstructured* and *structured* state management. Unstructured state management allows for flexible addition of attributes to the `state` object on the fly. Structured state management uses schemas, like Pydantic's `BaseModel`, for type safety and validation.  The choice depends on the complexity and requirements of the workflow.\n\n## Controlling the Flow: Logic and Routing\n\nFlows offer powerful tools for directing the execution path.  The `or_` function allows a method to listen to multiple methods and execute when *any* of them complete. Conversely, the `and_` function ensures a method only runs after *all* specified methods have finished.  The `@router()` decorator adds dynamic routing based on a method's output.  Different routes can be defined, allowing the workflow to branch based on the results of a specific task.\n\n## Integrating Crews\n\nFlows often incorporate multiple Crews, which are essentially self-contained modules within the larger workflow. The `crewai create flow <name>` command automatically sets up a project structure for managing these Crews.  The `crews` directory houses the code and configuration for each Crew. The `main.py` file ties everything together, defining the Flow and how the Crews interact.  Each Crew has its own configuration files (e.g., `agents.yaml`, `tasks.yaml`) within its directory.\n\n## Visualizing with Plots\n\nCrewAI provides a visualization tool to create interactive plots of your Flows.  This helps to understand the workflow structure and identify potential bottlenecks or logic errors.  Plots can be generated using the `plot()` method directly on a Flow instance or via the command line using `crewai flow plot`. These plots display the tasks as nodes and the execution flow as directed edges, offering a clear visual representation of the workflow.\n\n## Next Steps: Exploring Further\n\nCrewAI offers a rich set of example Flows showcasing a variety of use cases, from simple auto-responders to complex multi-stage processes.  Exploring these examples provides valuable insights into different flow patterns and best practices.  These examples demonstrate various scenarios like infinite loops for background tasks, human-in-the-loop interactions, chaining multiple Crews, and broadcasting events to trigger multiple actions.",

CrewAI Flows: An Overview\n\n**Detailed Explanation:** CrewAI Flows provide a structured approach to building complex AI workflows by connecting individual tasks and Crews. They manage execution, data flow, and state, making it easier to create sophisticated automation. (See Summary: Introduction to Flows)\n\n**Practical Example:** Imagine an AI workflow that generates a story. One Crew might generate characters, another Crew might generate plot points, and a final Crew might assemble the story. A Flow orchestrates these Crews, managing the data flow between them.\n\n**Key Terms:** Flows, Crews, Tasks\n\n**Study Tip:** Think of a Flow as a director coordinating actors (Crews) performing scenes (Tasks).\n\n**Common Pitfalls:** Not clearly defining the roles of each Crew, leading to overlapping functionalities.\n\n**Review Prompts:**\n1. What is the core purpose of a CrewAI Flow?\n2. How do Flows simplify the creation of complex AI workflows?\n\n\n## 2. Workflow Creation with Decorators\n\n**Detailed Explanation:** The `@start()` decorator marks the entry point(s) of a Flow. Multiple methods can have this decorator, enabling parallel execution. `@listen()` connects methods, triggering execution based on the completion of another method. (See Summary: Building Flows: Tasks and Decorators)\n\n**Practical Example:**\n```python\n@start()\ndef generate_city(state):\n    state.city = \"London\"\n\n@listen(generate_city)\ndef generate_weather(state):\n    print(f\"Weather in {state.city}\")\n```\n\n**Key Terms:** `@start()`, `@listen()`\n\n**Study Tip:** Remember that `@listen()` takes the method it's listening to as an argument.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**  Forgetting to include the `state` parameter in methods to access the shared state.\n\n**Visual Aid:**\n\n```\n[generate_city] --(listen)--> [generate_weather]\n```\n\n**Review Prompts:**\n1. What is the difference between `@start()` and `@listen()`?\n2. How can you initiate parallel execution in a Flow?\n\n\n## 3. State Management: Unstructured and Structured\n\n**Detailed Explanation:** Flows manage state, the data shared between methods.  Unstructured state allows flexible attribute addition, while structured state (e.g., using Pydantic's `BaseModel`) provides type safety and validation. (See Summary: Managing State)\n\n**Practical Example:**\n```python\n# Unstructured\nstate.city = \"London\"\n\n# Structured (using Pydantic)\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass MyState(BaseModel):\n  city: str\n\nstate = MyState(city=\"London\")\n```\n\n**Key Terms:** State, Unstructured State, Structured State, Pydantic's `BaseModel`\n\n**Study Tip:** Consider using structured state for complex workflows to benefit from type hints and validation.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:** Mixing unstructured and structured state without careful planning can lead to inconsistencies.\n\n**Visual Aid:**\n\n```\nUnstructured State:  Flexible, add attributes as needed.\nStructured State:   Predefined schema, type safety.\n```\n\n**Review Prompts:**\n1. When should you use structured state management?\n2. What are the advantages of using Pydantic's `BaseModel` for state management?\n\n\n## 4. Flow Control: or_, and_, and @router()\n\n**Detailed Explanation:** `or_` triggers a listener when *any* of the specified methods finish. `and_` triggers when *all* finish. `@router()` allows dynamic routing based on a method's output. (See Summary: Controlling the Flow: Logic and Routing)\n\n**Practical Example:**\n```python\n@listen(or_(method1, method2))  # Runs after method1 OR method2\n@listen(and_(method3, method4)) # Runs after method3 AND method4\n\n@router()\ndef route_flow(output):\n  if output == \"A\":\n    return method_a\n  return method_b\n```\n\n**Key Terms:** `or_`, `and_`, `@router()`\n\n**Study Tip:** Carefully consider which control flow mechanism best suits your workflow logic.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:** Incorrectly using `or_` and `and_` can lead to unexpected execution paths.\n\n**Review Prompts:**\n1. How does `or_` differ from `and_` in flow control?\n2. Explain the purpose of `@router()`.\n\n\n\n## 5. Connecting Crews: Building Modular Workflows\n\n**Detailed Explanation:** Crews are modular components within a Flow.  `crewai create flow <name>` sets up the project structure. Crews reside in the `crews` directory, and `main.py` defines the Flow and Crew interactions. (See Summary: Integrating Crews)\n\n**Key Terms:** Crews, `crewai create flow`, `crews` directory, `main.py`\n\n**Study Tip:** Design Crews with specific functionalities to promote reusability and maintainability.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:** Tightly coupling Crews can reduce flexibility and make it harder to modify the workflow.\n\n**Review Prompts:**\n1.  What is the role of the `crews` directory in a Flow project?\n2.  How does `main.py` connect the different Crews within a Flow?\n\n\n## 6. Visualizing Flows: Plotting for Clarity\n\n**Detailed Explanation:** The `plot()` method or `crewai flow plot` command generates visual representations of Flows, aiding in understanding the workflow structure and identifying potential issues. (See Summary: Visualizing with Plots)\n\n**Key Terms:** `plot()`, `crewai flow plot`\n\n**Study Tip:** Regularly visualize your Flows, especially complex ones, to ensure the logic is correct.\n\n**Review Prompts:**\n1. How can you generate a visual representation of a Flow?\n2. What are the benefits of visualizing Flows?\n\n\nThis completes the study guide. Be sure to review the summary and this guide thoroughly before taking the quiz.  Good luck!",

Flows allow developers to combine and coordinate coding tasks and Crews efficiently, providing a robust framework for building sophisticated AI automations.\nFlows allow you to create structured, event-driven workflows. They provide a seamless way to connect multiple tasks, manage state, and control the flow of execution in your AI applications. With Flows, you can easily design and implement multi-step processes that leverage the full potential of CrewAI\u2019s capabilities.\n  1. **Simplified Workflow Creation** : Easily chain together multiple Crews and tasks to create complex AI workflows.\n  2. **State Management** : Flows make it super easy to manage and share state between different tasks in your workflow.\n  3. **Event-Driven Architecture** : Built on an event-driven model, allowing for dynamic and responsive workflows.\n  4. **Flexible Control Flow** : Implement conditional logic, loops, and branching within your workflows.\n\n\n## Getting Started\nLet\u2019s create a simple Flow where you will use OpenAI to generate a random city in one task and then use that city to generate a fun fact in another task.\n\n```python\n\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom litellm import completion\n\n\nclass ExampleFlow(Flow):\n    model = \"gpt-4o-mini\"\n\n    @start()\n    def generate_city(self):\n        print(\"Starting flow\")\n\n        response = completion(\n            model=self.model,\n            messages=[\n                {\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                    \"content\": \"Return the name of a random city in the world.\",\n                },\n            ],\n        )\n\n        random_city = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n        print(f\"Random City: {random_city}\")\n\n        return random_city\n\n    @listen(generate_city)\n    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):\n        response = completion(\n            model=self.model,\n            messages=[\n                {\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                    \"content\": f\"Tell me a fun fact about {random_city}\",\n                },\n            ],\n        )\n\n        fun_fact = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n        return fun_fact\n\n\n\nflow = ExampleFlow()\nresult = flow.kickoff()\n\nprint(f\"Generated fun fact: {result}\")\n```\n\nIn the above example, we have created a simple Flow that generates a random city using OpenAI and then generates a fun fact about that city. The Flow consists of two tasks: `generate_city` and `generate_fun_fact`. The `generate_city` task is the starting point of the Flow, and the `generate_fun_fact` task listens for the output of the `generate_city` task.\nWhen you run the Flow, it will generate a random city and then generate a fun fact about that city. The output will be printed to the console.\n**Note:** Ensure you have set up your `.env` file to store your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. This key is necessary for authenticating requests to the OpenAI API.\n\n### @start()\nThe `@start()` decorator is used to mark a method as the starting point of a Flow. When a Flow is started, all the methods decorated with `@start()` are executed in parallel. You can have multiple start methods in a Flow, and they will all be executed when the Flow is started.\n### @listen()\n\nThe `@listen()` decorator is used to mark a method as a listener for the output of another task in the Flow. The method decorated with `@listen()` will be executed when the specified task emits an output. The method can access the output of the task it is listening to as an argument.\n\n#### Usage\nThe `@listen()` decorator can be used in several ways:\n  1. **Listening to a Method by Name** : You can pass the name of the method you want to listen to as a string. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.\n    ```python\n    @listen(\"generate_city\")\n    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):\n    # Implementation\n\n    ```\n\n  2. **Listening to a Method Directly** : You can pass the method itself. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.\n    ```python\n    @listen(generate_city)\n    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):\n    # Implementation\n\n    ```\n\n### Flow Output\nAccessing and handling the output of a Flow is essential for integrating your AI workflows into larger applications or systems. CrewAI Flows provide straightforward mechanisms to retrieve the final output, access intermediate results, and manage the overall state of your Flow.\n\n#### Retrieving the Final Output\nWhen you run a Flow, the final output is determined by the last method that completes. The `kickoff()` method returns the output of this final method.\nHere\u2019s how you can access the final output:\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nclass OutputExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    return \"Output from first_method\"\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self, first_output):\n    return f\"Second method received: {first_output}\"\n\nflow = OutputExampleFlow()\nfinal_output = flow.kickoff()\nprint(\"---- Final Output ----\")\nprint(final_output)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `second_method` is the last method to complete, so its output will be the final output of the Flow. The `kickoff()` method will return the final output, which is then printed to the console.\n\n#### Accessing and Updating State\nIn addition to retrieving the final output, you can also access and update the state within your Flow. The state can be used to store and share data between different methods in the Flow. After the Flow has run, you can access the state to retrieve any information that was added or updated during the execution.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how to update and access the state:\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nclass ExampleState(BaseModel):\n  counter: int = 0\n  message: str = \"\"\nclass StateExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    self.state.message = \"Hello from first_method\"\n    self.state.counter += 1\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state.message += \" - updated by second_method\"\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    return self.state.message\nflow = StateExampleFlow()\nfinal_output = flow.kickoff()\nprint(f\"Final Output: {final_output}\")\nprint(\"Final State:\")\nprint(flow.state)\n```\n\nIn this example, the state is updated by both `first_method` and `second_method`. After the Flow has run, you can access the final state to see the updates made by these methods.\nBy ensuring that the final method\u2019s output is returned and providing access to the state, CrewAI Flows make it easy to integrate the results of your AI workflows into larger applications or systems, while also maintaining and accessing the state throughout the Flow\u2019s execution.\n\n## Flow State Management\nManaging state effectively is crucial for building reliable and maintainable AI workflows. CrewAI Flows provides robust mechanisms for both unstructured and structured state management, allowing developers to choose the approach that best fits their application\u2019s needs.\n\n### Unstructured State Management\nIn unstructured state management, all state is stored in the `state` attribute of the `Flow` class. This approach offers flexibility, enabling developers to add or modify state attributes on the fly without defining a strict schema.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nclass UntructuredExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    self.state.message = \"Hello from structured flow\"\n    self.state.counter = 0\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated\"\n  @listen(second_method)\n  def third_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated again\"\n    print(f\"State after third_method: {self.state}\")\n\nflow = UntructuredExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n  * **Flexibility:** You can dynamically add attributes to `self.state` without predefined constraints.\n  * **Simplicity:** Ideal for straightforward workflows where state structure is minimal or varies significantly.\n\n### Structured State Management\nStructured state management leverages predefined schemas to ensure consistency and type safety across the workflow. By using models like Pydantic\u2019s `BaseModel`, developers can define the exact shape of the state, enabling better validation and auto-completion in development environments.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass ExampleState(BaseModel):\n  counter: int = 0\n  message: str = \"\"\n\nclass StructuredExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    self.state.message = \"Hello from structured flow\"\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated\"\n  @listen(second_method)\n  def third_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated again\"\n    print(f\"State after third_method: {self.state}\")\n\nflow = StructuredExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n  * **Defined Schema:** `ExampleState` clearly outlines the state structure, enhancing code readability and maintainability.\n  * **Type Safety:** Leveraging Pydantic ensures that state attributes adhere to the specified types, reducing runtime errors.\n  * **Auto-Completion:** IDEs can provide better auto-completion and error checking based on the defined state model.\n\n\n### Choosing Between Unstructured and Structured State Management\n  * **Use Unstructured State Management when:**\n    * The workflow\u2019s state is simple or highly dynamic.\n    * Flexibility is prioritized over strict state definitions.\n    * Rapid prototyping is required without the overhead of defining schemas.\n  * **Use Structured State Management when:**\n    * The workflow requires a well-defined and consistent state structure.\n    * Type safety and validation are important for your application\u2019s reliability.\n    * You want to leverage IDE features like auto-completion and type checking for better developer experience.\n\n\nBy providing both unstructured and structured state management options, CrewAI Flows empowers developers to build AI workflows that are both flexible and robust, catering to a wide range of application requirements.\n\n## Flow Control\n\n### Conditional Logic: `or`\nThe `or_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, or_, start\nclass OrExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def start_method(self):\n    return \"Hello from the start method\"\n  @listen(start_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    return \"Hello from the second method\"\n  @listen(or_(start_method, second_method))\n  def logger(self, result):\n    print(f\"Logger: {result}\")\n\nflow = OrExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n```\n\nWhen you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered by the output of either the `start_method` or the `second_method`. The `or_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.\n\n### Conditional Logic: `and`\nThe `and_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, and_, listen, start\nclass AndExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def start_method(self):\n    self.state[\"greeting\"] = \"Hello from the start method\"\n  @listen(start_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state[\"joke\"] = \"What do computers eat? Microchips.\"\n  @listen(and_(start_method, second_method))\n  def logger(self):\n    print(\"---- Logger ----\")\n    print(self.state)\nflow = AndExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n```\n\nWhen you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered only when both the `start_method` and the `second_method` emit an output. The `and_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.\n### Router\nThe `@router()` decorator in Flows allows you to define conditional routing logic based on the output of a method. You can specify different routes based on the output of the method, allowing you to control the flow of execution dynamically.\n\n\n```python\nimport random\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, router, start\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nclass ExampleState(BaseModel):\n  success_flag: bool = False\nclass RouterFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):\n  @start()\n  def start_method(self):\n    print(\"Starting the structured flow\")\n    random_boolean = random.choice([True, False])\n    self.state.success_flag = random_boolean\n  @router(start_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    if self.state.success_flag:\n      return \"success\"\n    else:\n      return \"failed\"\n  @listen(\"success\")\n  def third_method(self):\n    print(\"Third method running\")\n  @listen(\"failed\")\n  def fourth_method(self):\n    print(\"Fourth method running\")\n\nflow = RouterFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `start_method` generates a random boolean value and sets it in the state. The `second_method` uses the `@router()` decorator to define conditional routing logic based on the value of the boolean. If the boolean is `True`, the method returns `\"success\"`, and if it is `False`, the method returns `\"failed\"`. The `third_method` and `fourth_method` listen to the output of the `second_method` and execute based on the returned value.\nWhen you run this Flow, the output will change based on the random boolean value generated by the `start_method`.\n\n## Adding Crews to Flows\nCreating a flow with multiple crews in CrewAI is straightforward.\nYou can generate a new CrewAI project that includes all the scaffolding needed to create a flow with multiple crews by running the following command:\n\n```bash\ncrewai create flow name_of_flow\n```\n\nThis command will generate a new CrewAI project with the necessary folder structure. The generated project includes a prebuilt crew called `poem_crew` that is already working. You can use this crew as a template by copying, pasting, and editing it to create other crews.\n\n### Folder Structure\nAfter running the `crewai create flow name_of_flow` command, you will see a folder structure similar to the following:\nDirectory/File| Description  \n---|---  \n`name_of_flow/`| Root directory for the flow.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `crews/`| Contains directories for specific crews.  \n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 `poem_crew/`| Directory for the \u201cpoem_crew\u201d with its configurations and scripts.  \n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 `config/`| Configuration files directory for the \u201cpoem_crew\u201d.  \n\u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 `agents.yaml`| YAML file defining the agents for \u201cpoem_crew\u201d.  \n\u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 `tasks.yaml`| YAML file defining the tasks for \u201cpoem_crew\u201d.  \n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 `poem_crew.py`| Script for \u201cpoem_crew\u201d functionality.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `tools/`| Directory for additional tools used in the flow.  \n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 `custom_tool.py`| Custom tool implementation.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `main.py`| Main script for running the flow.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `README.md`| Project description and instructions.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `pyproject.toml`| Configuration file for project dependencies and settings.  \n\u2514\u2500\u2500 `.gitignore`| Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control.  \n\n### Building Your Crews\nIn the `crews` folder, you can define multiple crews. Each crew will have its own folder containing configuration files and the crew definition file. For example, the `poem_crew` folder contains:\n  * `config/agents.yaml`: Defines the agents for the crew.\n  * `config/tasks.yaml`: Defines the tasks for the crew.\n  * `poem_crew.py`: Contains the crew definition, including agents, tasks, and the crew itself.\n\nYou can copy, paste, and edit the `poem_crew` to create other crews.\n\n### Connecting Crews in `main.py`\nThe `main.py` file is where you create your flow and connect the crews together. You can define your flow by using the `Flow` class and the decorators `@start` and `@listen` to specify the flow of execution.\nHere\u2019s an example of how you can connect the `poem_crew` in the `main.py` file:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nfrom random import randint\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom .crews.poem_crew.poem_crew import PoemCrew\nclass PoemState(BaseModel):\n  sentence_count: int = 1\n  poem: str = \"\"\nclass PoemFlow(Flow[PoemState]):\n  @start()\n  def generate_sentence_count(self):\n    print(\"Generating sentence count\")\n    self.state.sentence_count = randint(1, 5)\n  @listen(generate_sentence_count)\n  def generate_poem(self):\n    print(\"Generating poem\")\n    result = PoemCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs={\"sentence_count\": self.state.sentence_count})\n    print(\"Poem generated\", result.raw)\n    self.state.poem = result.raw\n  @listen(generate_poem)\n  def save_poem(self):\n    print(\"Saving poem\")\n    with open(\"poem.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n      f.write(self.state.poem)\ndef kickoff():\n  poem_flow = PoemFlow()\n  poem_flow.kickoff()\n\ndef plot():\n  poem_flow = PoemFlow()\n  poem_flow.plot()\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  kickoff()\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the `PoemFlow` class defines a flow that generates a sentence count, uses the `PoemCrew` to generate a poem, and then saves the poem to a file. The flow is kicked off by calling the `kickoff()` method.\n\n### Running the Flow\n(Optional) Before running the flow, you can install the dependencies by running:\n\n```bash\ncrewai install\n```\n\nOnce all of the dependencies are installed, you need to activate the virtual environment by running:\n```bash\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nAfter activating the virtual environment, you can run the flow by executing one of the following commands:\n```bash\ncrewai flow kickoff\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nuv run kickoff\n\n```\n\nThe flow will execute, and you should see the output in the console.\n\n## Plot Flows\nVisualizing your AI workflows can provide valuable insights into the structure and execution paths of your flows. CrewAI offers a powerful visualization tool that allows you to generate interactive plots of your flows, making it easier to understand and optimize your AI workflows.\n\n### What are Plots?\nPlots in CrewAI are graphical representations of your AI workflows. They display the various tasks, their connections, and the flow of data between them. This visualization helps in understanding the sequence of operations, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring that the workflow logic aligns with your expectations.\n### How to Generate a Plot\n\nCrewAI provides two convenient methods to generate plots of your flows:\n#### Option 1: Using the `plot()` Method\nIf you are working directly with a flow instance, you can generate a plot by calling the `plot()` method on your flow object. This method will create an HTML file containing the interactive plot of your flow.\n\n```python\n# Assuming you have a flow instance\nflow.plot(\"my_flow_plot\")\n\n```\n\nThis will generate a file named `my_flow_plot.html` in your current directory. You can open this file in a web browser to view the interactive plot.\n#### Option 2: Using the Command Line\nIf you are working within a structured CrewAI project, you can generate a plot using the command line. This is particularly useful for larger projects where you want to visualize the entire flow setup.\n\n```bash\ncrewai flow plot\n```\n\nThis command will generate an HTML file with the plot of your flow, similar to the `plot()` method. The file will be saved in your project directory, and you can open it in a web browser to explore the flow.\n\n### Understanding the Plot\nThe generated plot will display nodes representing the tasks in your flow, with directed edges indicating the flow of execution. The plot is interactive, allowing you to zoom in and out, and hover over nodes to see additional details.\nBy visualizing your flows, you can gain a clearer understanding of the workflow\u2019s structure, making it easier to debug, optimize, and communicate your AI processes to others.\n\n### Conclusion\nPlotting your flows is a powerful feature of CrewAI that enhances your ability to design and manage complex AI workflows. Whether you choose to use the `plot()` method or the command line, generating plots will provide you with a visual representation of your workflows, aiding in both development and presentation.\n\n## Next Steps\nIf you\u2019re interested in exploring additional examples of flows, we have a variety of recommendations in our examples repository. Here are four specific flow examples, each showcasing unique use cases to help you match your current problem type to a specific example:\n  1. **Email Auto Responder Flow** : This example demonstrates an infinite loop where a background job continually runs to automate email responses. It\u2019s a great use case for tasks that need to be performed repeatedly without manual intervention. View Example\n  2. **Lead Score Flow** : This flow showcases adding human-in-the-loop feedback and handling different conditional branches using the router. It\u2019s an excellent example of how to incorporate dynamic decision-making and human oversight into your workflows. View Example\n  3. **Write a Book Flow** : This example excels at chaining multiple crews together, where the output of one crew is used by another. Specifically, one crew outlines an entire book, and another crew generates chapters based on the outline. Eventually, everything is connected to produce a complete book. This flow is perfect for complex, multi-step processes that require coordination between different tasks. View Example\n  4. **Meeting Assistant Flow** : This flow demonstrates how to broadcast one event to trigger multiple follow-up actions. For instance, after a meeting is completed, the flow can update a Trello board, send a Slack message, and save the results. It\u2019s a great example of handling multiple outcomes from a single event, making it ideal for comprehensive task management and notification systems.

Flows allow developers to combine and coordinate coding tasks and Crews efficiently, providing a robust framework for building sophisticated AI automations.\nFlows allow you to create structured, event-driven workflows. They provide a seamless way to connect multiple tasks, manage state, and control the flow of execution in your AI applications. With Flows, you can easily design and implement multi-step processes that leverage the full potential of CrewAI\u2019s capabilities.\n  1. **Simplified Workflow Creation** : Easily chain together multiple Crews and tasks to create complex AI workflows.\n  2. **State Management** : Flows make it super easy to manage and share state between different tasks in your workflow.\n  3. **Event-Driven Architecture** : Built on an event-driven model, allowing for dynamic and responsive workflows.\n  4. **Flexible Control Flow** : Implement conditional logic, loops, and branching within your workflows.\n\n\n## Getting Started\nLet\u2019s create a simple Flow where you will use OpenAI to generate a random city in one task and then use that city to generate a fun fact in another task.\n\n```python\n\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom litellm import completion\n\n\nclass ExampleFlow(Flow):\n    model = \"gpt-4o-mini\"\n\n    @start()\n    def generate_city(self):\n        print(\"Starting flow\")\n\n        response = completion(\n            model=self.model,\n            messages=[\n                {\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                    \"content\": \"Return the name of a random city in the world.\",\n                },\n            ],\n        )\n\n        random_city = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n        print(f\"Random City: {random_city}\")\n\n        return random_city\n\n    @listen(generate_city)\n    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):\n        response = completion(\n            model=self.model,\n            messages=[\n                {\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                    \"content\": f\"Tell me a fun fact about {random_city}\",\n                },\n            ],\n        )\n\n        fun_fact = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n        return fun_fact\n\n\n\nflow = ExampleFlow()\nresult = flow.kickoff()\n\nprint(f\"Generated fun fact: {result}\")\n```\n\nIn the above example, we have created a simple Flow that generates a random city using OpenAI and then generates a fun fact about that city. The Flow consists of two tasks: `generate_city` and `generate_fun_fact`. The `generate_city` task is the starting point of the Flow, and the `generate_fun_fact` task listens for the output of the `generate_city` task.\nWhen you run the Flow, it will generate a random city and then generate a fun fact about that city. The output will be printed to the console.\n**Note:** Ensure you have set up your `.env` file to store your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. This key is necessary for authenticating requests to the OpenAI API.\n\n### @start()\nThe `@start()` decorator is used to mark a method as the starting point of a Flow. When a Flow is started, all the methods decorated with `@start()` are executed in parallel. You can have multiple start methods in a Flow, and they will all be executed when the Flow is started.\n### @listen()\n\nThe `@listen()` decorator is used to mark a method as a listener for the output of another task in the Flow. The method decorated with `@listen()` will be executed when the specified task emits an output. The method can access the output of the task it is listening to as an argument.\n\n#### Usage\nThe `@listen()` decorator can be used in several ways:\n  1. **Listening to a Method by Name** : You can pass the name of the method you want to listen to as a string. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.\n    ```python\n    @listen(\"generate_city\")\n    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):\n    # Implementation\n\n    ```\n\n  2. **Listening to a Method Directly** : You can pass the method itself. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.\n    ```python\n    @listen(generate_city)\n    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):\n    # Implementation\n\n    ```\n\n### Flow Output\nAccessing and handling the output of a Flow is essential for integrating your AI workflows into larger applications or systems. CrewAI Flows provide straightforward mechanisms to retrieve the final output, access intermediate results, and manage the overall state of your Flow.\n\n#### Retrieving the Final Output\nWhen you run a Flow, the final output is determined by the last method that completes. The `kickoff()` method returns the output of this final method.\nHere\u2019s how you can access the final output:\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nclass OutputExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    return \"Output from first_method\"\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self, first_output):\n    return f\"Second method received: {first_output}\"\n\nflow = OutputExampleFlow()\nfinal_output = flow.kickoff()\nprint(\"---- Final Output ----\")\nprint(final_output)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `second_method` is the last method to complete, so its output will be the final output of the Flow. The `kickoff()` method will return the final output, which is then printed to the console.\n\n#### Accessing and Updating State\nIn addition to retrieving the final output, you can also access and update the state within your Flow. The state can be used to store and share data between different methods in the Flow. After the Flow has run, you can access the state to retrieve any information that was added or updated during the execution.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how to update and access the state:\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nclass ExampleState(BaseModel):\n  counter: int = 0\n  message: str = \"\"\nclass StateExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    self.state.message = \"Hello from first_method\"\n    self.state.counter += 1\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state.message += \" - updated by second_method\"\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    return self.state.message\nflow = StateExampleFlow()\nfinal_output = flow.kickoff()\nprint(f\"Final Output: {final_output}\")\nprint(\"Final State:\")\nprint(flow.state)\n```\n\nIn this example, the state is updated by both `first_method` and `second_method`. After the Flow has run, you can access the final state to see the updates made by these methods.\nBy ensuring that the final method\u2019s output is returned and providing access to the state, CrewAI Flows make it easy to integrate the results of your AI workflows into larger applications or systems, while also maintaining and accessing the state throughout the Flow\u2019s execution.\n\n## Flow State Management\nManaging state effectively is crucial for building reliable and maintainable AI workflows. CrewAI Flows provides robust mechanisms for both unstructured and structured state management, allowing developers to choose the approach that best fits their application\u2019s needs.\n\n### Unstructured State Management\nIn unstructured state management, all state is stored in the `state` attribute of the `Flow` class. This approach offers flexibility, enabling developers to add or modify state attributes on the fly without defining a strict schema.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nclass UntructuredExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    self.state.message = \"Hello from structured flow\"\n    self.state.counter = 0\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated\"\n  @listen(second_method)\n  def third_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated again\"\n    print(f\"State after third_method: {self.state}\")\n\nflow = UntructuredExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n  * **Flexibility:** You can dynamically add attributes to `self.state` without predefined constraints.\n  * **Simplicity:** Ideal for straightforward workflows where state structure is minimal or varies significantly.\n\n### Structured State Management\nStructured state management leverages predefined schemas to ensure consistency and type safety across the workflow. By using models like Pydantic\u2019s `BaseModel`, developers can define the exact shape of the state, enabling better validation and auto-completion in development environments.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass ExampleState(BaseModel):\n  counter: int = 0\n  message: str = \"\"\n\nclass StructuredExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):\n  @start()\n  def first_method(self):\n    self.state.message = \"Hello from structured flow\"\n  @listen(first_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated\"\n  @listen(second_method)\n  def third_method(self):\n    self.state.counter += 1\n    self.state.message += \" - updated again\"\n    print(f\"State after third_method: {self.state}\")\n\nflow = StructuredExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n  * **Defined Schema:** `ExampleState` clearly outlines the state structure, enhancing code readability and maintainability.\n  * **Type Safety:** Leveraging Pydantic ensures that state attributes adhere to the specified types, reducing runtime errors.\n  * **Auto-Completion:** IDEs can provide better auto-completion and error checking based on the defined state model.\n\n\n### Choosing Between Unstructured and Structured State Management\n  * **Use Unstructured State Management when:**\n    * The workflow\u2019s state is simple or highly dynamic.\n    * Flexibility is prioritized over strict state definitions.\n    * Rapid prototyping is required without the overhead of defining schemas.\n  * **Use Structured State Management when:**\n    * The workflow requires a well-defined and consistent state structure.\n    * Type safety and validation are important for your application\u2019s reliability.\n    * You want to leverage IDE features like auto-completion and type checking for better developer experience.\n\n\nBy providing both unstructured and structured state management options, CrewAI Flows empowers developers to build AI workflows that are both flexible and robust, catering to a wide range of application requirements.\n\n## Flow Control\n\n### Conditional Logic: `or`\nThe `or_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, or_, start\nclass OrExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def start_method(self):\n    return \"Hello from the start method\"\n  @listen(start_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    return \"Hello from the second method\"\n  @listen(or_(start_method, second_method))\n  def logger(self, result):\n    print(f\"Logger: {result}\")\n\nflow = OrExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n```\n\nWhen you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered by the output of either the `start_method` or the `second_method`. The `or_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.\n\n### Conditional Logic: `and`\nThe `and_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, and_, listen, start\nclass AndExampleFlow(Flow):\n  @start()\n  def start_method(self):\n    self.state[\"greeting\"] = \"Hello from the start method\"\n  @listen(start_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    self.state[\"joke\"] = \"What do computers eat? Microchips.\"\n  @listen(and_(start_method, second_method))\n  def logger(self):\n    print(\"---- Logger ----\")\n    print(self.state)\nflow = AndExampleFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n```\n\nWhen you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered only when both the `start_method` and the `second_method` emit an output. The `and_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.\n### Router\nThe `@router()` decorator in Flows allows you to define conditional routing logic based on the output of a method. You can specify different routes based on the output of the method, allowing you to control the flow of execution dynamically.\n\n\n```python\nimport random\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, router, start\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nclass ExampleState(BaseModel):\n  success_flag: bool = False\nclass RouterFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):\n  @start()\n  def start_method(self):\n    print(\"Starting the structured flow\")\n    random_boolean = random.choice([True, False])\n    self.state.success_flag = random_boolean\n  @router(start_method)\n  def second_method(self):\n    if self.state.success_flag:\n      return \"success\"\n    else:\n      return \"failed\"\n  @listen(\"success\")\n  def third_method(self):\n    print(\"Third method running\")\n  @listen(\"failed\")\n  def fourth_method(self):\n    print(\"Fourth method running\")\n\nflow = RouterFlow()\nflow.kickoff()\n\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `start_method` generates a random boolean value and sets it in the state. The `second_method` uses the `@router()` decorator to define conditional routing logic based on the value of the boolean. If the boolean is `True`, the method returns `\"success\"`, and if it is `False`, the method returns `\"failed\"`. The `third_method` and `fourth_method` listen to the output of the `second_method` and execute based on the returned value.\nWhen you run this Flow, the output will change based on the random boolean value generated by the `start_method`.\n\n## Adding Crews to Flows\nCreating a flow with multiple crews in CrewAI is straightforward.\nYou can generate a new CrewAI project that includes all the scaffolding needed to create a flow with multiple crews by running the following command:\n\n```bash\ncrewai create flow name_of_flow\n```\n\nThis command will generate a new CrewAI project with the necessary folder structure. The generated project includes a prebuilt crew called `poem_crew` that is already working. You can use this crew as a template by copying, pasting, and editing it to create other crews.\n\n### Folder Structure\nAfter running the `crewai create flow name_of_flow` command, you will see a folder structure similar to the following:\nDirectory/File| Description  \n---|---  \n`name_of_flow/`| Root directory for the flow.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `crews/`| Contains directories for specific crews.  \n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 `poem_crew/`| Directory for the \u201cpoem_crew\u201d with its configurations and scripts.  \n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 `config/`| Configuration files directory for the \u201cpoem_crew\u201d.  \n\u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 `agents.yaml`| YAML file defining the agents for \u201cpoem_crew\u201d.  \n\u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 `tasks.yaml`| YAML file defining the tasks for \u201cpoem_crew\u201d.  \n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 `poem_crew.py`| Script for \u201cpoem_crew\u201d functionality.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `tools/`| Directory for additional tools used in the flow.  \n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 `custom_tool.py`| Custom tool implementation.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `main.py`| Main script for running the flow.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `README.md`| Project description and instructions.  \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 `pyproject.toml`| Configuration file for project dependencies and settings.  \n\u2514\u2500\u2500 `.gitignore`| Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control.  \n\n### Building Your Crews\nIn the `crews` folder, you can define multiple crews. Each crew will have its own folder containing configuration files and the crew definition file. For example, the `poem_crew` folder contains:\n  * `config/agents.yaml`: Defines the agents for the crew.\n  * `config/tasks.yaml`: Defines the tasks for the crew.\n  * `poem_crew.py`: Contains the crew definition, including agents, tasks, and the crew itself.\n\nYou can copy, paste, and edit the `poem_crew` to create other crews.\n\n### Connecting Crews in `main.py`\nThe `main.py` file is where you create your flow and connect the crews together. You can define your flow by using the `Flow` class and the decorators `@start` and `@listen` to specify the flow of execution.\nHere\u2019s an example of how you can connect the `poem_crew` in the `main.py` file:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nfrom random import randint\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start\nfrom .crews.poem_crew.poem_crew import PoemCrew\nclass PoemState(BaseModel):\n  sentence_count: int = 1\n  poem: str = \"\"\nclass PoemFlow(Flow[PoemState]):\n  @start()\n  def generate_sentence_count(self):\n    print(\"Generating sentence count\")\n    self.state.sentence_count = randint(1, 5)\n  @listen(generate_sentence_count)\n  def generate_poem(self):\n    print(\"Generating poem\")\n    result = PoemCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs={\"sentence_count\": self.state.sentence_count})\n    print(\"Poem generated\", result.raw)\n    self.state.poem = result.raw\n  @listen(generate_poem)\n  def save_poem(self):\n    print(\"Saving poem\")\n    with open(\"poem.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n      f.write(self.state.poem)\ndef kickoff():\n  poem_flow = PoemFlow()\n  poem_flow.kickoff()\n\ndef plot():\n  poem_flow = PoemFlow()\n  poem_flow.plot()\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  kickoff()\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the `PoemFlow` class defines a flow that generates a sentence count, uses the `PoemCrew` to generate a poem, and then saves the poem to a file. The flow is kicked off by calling the `kickoff()` method.\n\n### Running the Flow\n(Optional) Before running the flow, you can install the dependencies by running:\n\n```bash\ncrewai install\n```\n\nOnce all of the dependencies are installed, you need to activate the virtual environment by running:\n```bash\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nAfter activating the virtual environment, you can run the flow by executing one of the following commands:\n```bash\ncrewai flow kickoff\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nuv run kickoff\n\n```\n\nThe flow will execute, and you should see the output in the console.\n\n## Plot Flows\nVisualizing your AI workflows can provide valuable insights into the structure and execution paths of your flows. CrewAI offers a powerful visualization tool that allows you to generate interactive plots of your flows, making it easier to understand and optimize your AI workflows.\n\n### What are Plots?\nPlots in CrewAI are graphical representations of your AI workflows. They display the various tasks, their connections, and the flow of data between them. This visualization helps in understanding the sequence of operations, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring that the workflow logic aligns with your expectations.\n### How to Generate a Plot\n\nCrewAI provides two convenient methods to generate plots of your flows:\n#### Option 1: Using the `plot()` Method\nIf you are working directly with a flow instance, you can generate a plot by calling the `plot()` method on your flow object. This method will create an HTML file containing the interactive plot of your flow.\n\n```python\n# Assuming you have a flow instance\nflow.plot(\"my_flow_plot\")\n\n```\n\nThis will generate a file named `my_flow_plot.html` in your current directory. You can open this file in a web browser to view the interactive plot.\n#### Option 2: Using the Command Line\nIf you are working within a structured CrewAI project, you can generate a plot using the command line. This is particularly useful for larger projects where you want to visualize the entire flow setup.\n\n```bash\ncrewai flow plot\n```\n\nThis command will generate an HTML file with the plot of your flow, similar to the `plot()` method. The file will be saved in your project directory, and you can open it in a web browser to explore the flow.\n\n### Understanding the Plot\nThe generated plot will display nodes representing the tasks in your flow, with directed edges indicating the flow of execution. The plot is interactive, allowing you to zoom in and out, and hover over nodes to see additional details.\nBy visualizing your flows, you can gain a clearer understanding of the workflow\u2019s structure, making it easier to debug, optimize, and communicate your AI processes to others.\n\n### Conclusion\nPlotting your flows is a powerful feature of CrewAI that enhances your ability to design and manage complex AI workflows. Whether you choose to use the `plot()` method or the command line, generating plots will provide you with a visual representation of your workflows, aiding in both development and presentation.\n\n## Next Steps\nIf you\u2019re interested in exploring additional examples of flows, we have a variety of recommendations in our examples repository. Here are four specific flow examples, each showcasing unique use cases to help you match your current problem type to a specific example:\n  1. **Email Auto Responder Flow** : This example demonstrates an infinite loop where a background job continually runs to automate email responses. It\u2019s a great use case for tasks that need to be performed repeatedly without manual intervention. View Example\n  2. **Lead Score Flow** : This flow showcases adding human-in-the-loop feedback and handling different conditional branches using the router. It\u2019s an excellent example of how to incorporate dynamic decision-making and human oversight into your workflows. View Example\n  3. **Write a Book Flow** : This example excels at chaining multiple crews together, where the output of one crew is used by another. Specifically, one crew outlines an entire book, and another crew generates chapters based on the outline. Eventually, everything is connected to produce a complete book. This flow is perfect for complex, multi-step processes that require coordination between different tasks. View Example\n  4. **Meeting Assistant Flow** : This flow demonstrates how to broadcast one event to trigger multiple follow-up actions. For instance, after a meeting is completed, the flow can update a Trello board, send a Slack message, and save the results. It\u2019s a great example of handling multiple outcomes from a single event, making it ideal for comprehensive task management and notification systems.

            "raw": "# Quiz Answers\n\nThis answer key provides detailed explanations for each quiz question, referencing relevant sections in the summary and study guide to reinforce learning objectives.  It also addresses common misconceptions and offers additional examples for deeper understanding.\n\n## Section 1: Flow Fundamentals (Basic Recall)\n\n1.  **What is the primary purpose of CrewAI Flows?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** The primary purpose of CrewAI Flows is to streamline the creation and management of complex AI workflows by connecting different tasks and Crews into a structured, event-driven system. This facilitates the development of sophisticated AI automations.\n\n    *   **Reasoning:** Flows offer an organized way to orchestrate the execution of multiple tasks, manage data flow between them, and handle state. (See Summary: Introduction to Flows, Study Guide: 1. CrewAI Flows: An Overview)\n\n    *   **Common Misconceptions:**  A common misconception is that Flows are limited to simple linear workflows.  Flows can handle complex branching, parallel execution, and dynamic routing.\n\n2.  **What are \"Crews\" in the context of CrewAI Flows?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** \"Crews\" are modular components or modules within a larger Flow. They encapsulate specific functionalities and can be reused across different Flows.\n\n    *   **Reasoning:**  Crews promote modularity and maintainability by breaking down complex workflows into smaller, manageable units. (See Summary: Integrating Crews, Study Guide: 5. Connecting Crews: Building Modular Workflows)\n\n    *   **Additional Example:**  A Crew could be responsible for sentiment analysis, another for language translation, and yet another for data extraction.  These Crews can then be combined within a Flow to perform a more complex task.\n\n3.  **Explain the difference between `@start()` and `@listen()` decorators.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**  `@start()` designates the starting point(s) of a Flow. Multiple methods can be decorated with `@start()`, enabling parallel execution at the beginning. `@listen()` connects methods, specifying that a method should execute *after* the completion of another method. The `@listen()` decorator takes the method it's listening to as an argument.\n\n    *   **Reasoning:** These decorators are fundamental for defining the execution flow within a Flow. (See Summary: Building Flows: Tasks and Decorators, Study Guide: 2. Workflow Creation with Decorators)\n\n    *   **Code Example:**\n        ```python\n        @start()\n        def task_a():\n            print(\"Task A started\")\n\n        @listen(task_a)\n        def task_b():\n            print(\"Task B started after Task A\")\n        ```\n\n4.  **What is the \"state\" within a Flow, and why is it important?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** The \"state\" is a shared data store within a Flow. It allows methods to access and modify data throughout the workflow's execution.\n\n    *   **Reasoning:**  State management is crucial for passing data between different tasks and maintaining consistency across the workflow.  (See Summary: Managing State, Study Guide: 3. State Management: Unstructured and Structured)\n\n    *   **Common Misconceptions:**  Confusing the Flow's state with local variables within a method.  The state is shared across the entire Flow, while local variables are only accessible within the method where they are defined.\n\n\n## Section 2: State Management and Flow Control (Applying Concepts)\n\n1.  **Describe the two main types of state management in CrewAI Flows and provide a simple code example for each.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**\n        *   **Unstructured State Management:** Allows flexible addition of attributes to the `state` object without a predefined schema.  This is convenient for simpler workflows but can lack type safety.\n\n            ```python\n            state.city = \"London\"\n            state.temperature = 20\n            ```\n\n        *   **Structured State Management:** Uses predefined schemas (e.g., Pydantic's `BaseModel`) to define the structure of the state. This provides type safety, validation, and better code maintainability.\n\n            ```python\n            from pydantic import BaseModel\n\n            class WeatherState(BaseModel):\n                city: str\n                temperature: int\n\n            state = WeatherState(city=\"London\", temperature=20)\n            ```\n\n    *   **Reasoning:** Understanding the different state management approaches allows you to choose the one that best suits your workflow's complexity and requirements. (See Summary: Managing State, Study Guide: 3. State Management: Unstructured and Structured)\n\n2.  **Explain the functionality of `or_` and `and_` in flow control. When would you use each?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**\n        *   **`or_`:** Triggers a listener method when *any* of the specified methods complete.  Use `or_` when you want a task to execute regardless of which of several preceding tasks finishes first.\n\n        *   **`and_`:** Triggers a listener method only when *all* of the specified methods complete. Use `and_` when a task depends on the completion of multiple preceding tasks.\n\n    *   **Reasoning:**  `or_` and `and_` provide fine-grained control over the execution flow based on dependencies between tasks. (See Summary: Controlling the Flow: Logic and Routing, Study Guide: 4. Flow Control: or_, and_, and @router())\n\n    *   **Example:**  In a data processing pipeline, you might use `or_` to trigger a logging task after either data cleaning or data transformation completes (since logging can happen after either). You would use `and_` to trigger a model training task only after *both* data cleaning and data transformation are finished.\n\n3.  **You have a method `validate_data` that checks the quality of incoming data. You want to execute `process_data` only if `validate_data` returns `True`. How would you implement this using `@router()`? Provide a code example.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**\n\n        ```python\n        @router(validate_data)\n        def route_data_processing(validation_result):\n            if validation_result:\n                return process_data\n\n        @listen(process_data) # Only triggered if validation_result is True\n        def post_processing():\n          print(\"Data processed successfully\")\n\n\n        @start()\n        def validate_data():\n            # ... data validation logic ...\n            return True  # or False based on validation\n\n        def process_data():\n           # ... data processing logic ...\n           print(\"Processing data...\")\n           return True\n\n        ```\n\n    *   **Reasoning:** `@router()` allows you to dynamically choose the next method to execute based on the output of the routed method. (See Summary: Controlling the Flow: Logic and Routing, Study Guide: 4. Flow Control: or_, and_, and @router())\n\n\n\n4.  **Imagine a scenario where you have three methods: `generate_ideas`, `refine_ideas`, and `finalize_ideas`. `refine_ideas` should run after `generate_ideas` completes. `finalize_ideas` should run only after *both* `generate_ideas` and `refine_ideas` are finished. Demonstrate how you would connect these methods using the appropriate decorators.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**\n\n        ```python\n        from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, and_, start\n\n        class IdeaFlow(Flow):\n\n            @start()\n            def generate_ideas(self):\n                # ... generate ideas logic ...\n                print(\"Ideas generated\")\n                return \"ideas\"\n\n            @listen(generate_ideas)\n            def refine_ideas(self, ideas):\n                # ... refine ideas logic ...\n                print(\"Ideas refined\")\n                return \"refined ideas\"\n\n            @listen(and_(generate_ideas, refine_ideas))\n            def finalize_ideas(self, ideas, refined_ideas):\n                # ... finalize ideas logic ...\n                print(\"Ideas finalized\")\n\n\n        ```\n\n    *   **Reasoning:**  `@listen()` ensures sequential execution, while `and_` ensures that `finalize_ideas` runs only after both preceding methods have completed.\n\n\n## Section 3: Integrating Crews and Visualization (Practical Application)\n\n1.  **Explain the purpose of the `crewai create flow <name>` command. Describe the resulting project structure.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**  The `crewai create flow <name>` command sets up a new CrewAI project specifically designed for flows.  It generates the necessary directory structure and files for organizing Crews and defining the flow logic.\n\n    *   **Project Structure:** (See Summary: Integrating Crews) The command creates a project directory with subdirectories for `crews` (containing individual Crew folders), `tools` (for custom tools), along with `main.py` (for the main flow definition), and configuration files. Each Crew directory further contains `config` (with `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` for Crew configuration) and a Python file for the Crew's implementation.\n\n2.  **How do you connect multiple Crews within a Flow? Which file is responsible for defining the Flow and the interactions between Crews?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**  Multiple Crews are connected within a Flow by instantiating them and calling their `crew().kickoff()` methods within the Flow's methods in `main.py`.  The `main.py` file is responsible for defining the overall Flow structure, connecting the Crews, and managing the flow of data between them.\n\n\n3.  **You have a complex Flow with multiple Crews and various conditional logic. How can you visualize this Flow to better understand its structure and execution path? Provide the command and/or method call.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** You can visualize a Flow by using the `plot()` method on a Flow instance: `flow.plot(\"flow_diagram\")`, or by using the command line: `crewai flow plot`.  This generates an interactive HTML file that visually represents the Flow's structure.\n\n    *   **Reasoning:** Visualizing complex Flows greatly aids in debugging, understanding execution paths, and communicating the workflow to others. (See Summary: Visualizing with Plots, Study Guide: 6. Visualizing Flows: Plotting for Clarity)\n\n4.  **Consider the \"Write a Book Flow\" example. Why is this a good example of chaining multiple Crews together? What is the benefit of this approach?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** The \"Write a Book Flow\" is a good example because it demonstrates how different Crews with specialized functionalities (e.g., outlining, chapter generation) can be chained together to perform a complex task.  This modular approach promotes reusability, maintainability, and allows for independent development and testing of each Crew.\n\n5.  **You want to build a Flow that monitors a social media feed for specific keywords.  When a keyword is detected, the Flow should trigger actions like sending a notification and logging the event. Which of the example Flows (Email Auto Responder, Lead Score, Write a Book, Meeting Assistant) is most similar to this scenario, and why?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** The **Meeting Assistant Flow** is the most similar.  It demonstrates how to \"broadcast\" a single event (in this case, the completion of a meeting) to trigger multiple follow-up actions.  Similarly, in the social media monitoring scenario, the detection of a keyword could be the event that triggers multiple actions like notification and logging.\n\n\n## Section 4: Advanced Scenarios (Critical Thinking)\n\n1.  **Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of unstructured versus structured state management. When would you choose one over the other?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**\n        *   **Unstructured State Management:**\n            *   **Advantages:** Flexibility, easy to add attributes on the fly.\n            *   **Disadvantages:**  Lack of type safety, potential for errors due to typos or inconsistent naming, harder to maintain in larger projects.\n\n        *   **Structured State Management:**\n            *   **Advantages:** Type safety, validation, improved code maintainability, auto-completion support in IDEs.\n            *   **Disadvantages:** Less flexible, requires defining a schema upfront.\n\n\n        *   **Choice:** Use unstructured state for simple, rapidly evolving workflows where flexibility is paramount. Choose structured state for complex workflows requiring maintainability, type safety, and where a well-defined schema is beneficial.\n\n\n2.  **How can you implement an infinite loop within a Flow? Which example Flow demonstrates this concept?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** An infinite loop can be implemented using a background task that continuously monitors for certain conditions or events. The **Email Auto Responder Flow** demonstrates this concept. It runs continuously in the background, checking for new emails and triggering automated responses.\n\n3.  **Explain the concept of \"broadcasting\" in the context of CrewAI Flows. Which example Flow showcases this feature? Provide a practical use case for broadcasting.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:** \"Broadcasting\" refers to the ability of a single event within a Flow to trigger multiple subsequent actions or tasks. The **Meeting Assistant Flow** showcases this feature.  A practical use case is sending notifications to multiple channels (email, Slack, SMS) after a specific event occurs, like a new user signing up or a critical error being detected.\n\n4.  **You are designing a Flow for a customer support system. A customer submits a ticket, and the Flow needs to route the ticket to the appropriate department based on the ticket's category. How would you implement this routing logic using the concepts discussed in the study guide?**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**  You would use the `@router()` decorator.  A method would analyze the ticket category and, based on the category, return the name of the method corresponding to the appropriate department.  The `@router()` would then direct the flow to that specific method.\n\n        ```python\n        @router(categorize_ticket)\n        def route_ticket(category):\n            if category == \"technical\":\n                return handle_technical_ticket\n            elif category == \"billing\":\n                return handle_billing_ticket\n            # ... other categories ...\n\n        def categorize_ticket(ticket):\n            # ... logic to extract ticket category ...\n            return \"technical\" # or \"billing\", etc.\n        ```\n\n5.  **What are some potential challenges you might encounter when working with Flows, and how would you address them? Consider factors like error handling, debugging, and maintaining complex workflows.**\n\n    *   **Correct Response:**\n        *   **Challenges:**\n            *   **Debugging complex Flows:** Use the `plot()` method to visualize the flow and identify bottlenecks or unexpected execution paths. Implement logging within each method to track the flow of data and identify errors.\n            *   **Error handling:** Implement `try-except` blocks within methods to handle potential errors gracefully and prevent the entire Flow from crashing.  Consider using a dedicated error handling Crew to centralize error management.\n            *   **Maintaining complex workflows:**  Use structured state management and well-defined Crew interfaces to improve code readability and maintainability.  Break down complex Flows into smaller, more manageable sub-flows if necessary.\n            *   **Circular dependencies:** Ensure that the flow logic does not create circular dependencies between methods, as this can lead to infinite loops or deadlocks.  Carefully plan the execution order using `@listen()` and flow control mechanisms.\n\n\nThis concludes the quiz answers.
