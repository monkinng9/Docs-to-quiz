## CrewAI Flows (Refer to Summary: Introduction to Flows)

CrewAI Flows orchestrate complex AI workflows, connecting tasks and Crews.  They offer a structured, event-driven approach to building robust AI automations.

**Example:** Imagine a flow that generates a product description and then translates it into multiple languages. Each step can be a separate task within the flow.

**Key Terms:**

* **Flow:** A structured, event-driven workflow.
* **Crew:** A collection of agents and tools.

**Study Tip:** Think of a Flow as a director coordinating different actors (tasks and Crews) in a play.

**Pitfalls:** Not clearly defining the inputs and outputs of each task can lead to integration issues.


**Review Prompts:**

* What is the primary purpose of CrewAI Flows?
* How do Flows contribute to building sophisticated AI automations?



## Workflow Creation (Refer to Summary: Getting Started with Flows)

Flows simplify the process of chaining together multiple Crews and tasks.

**Example:**  A flow could start with a task to generate an image, followed by a task to classify the image, and finally a task to store the results.

**Key Terms:**

* `@start()`: Decorator marking the beginning of a Flow.

**Study Tip:** Start with a simple flow involving two tasks and gradually increase complexity.  Ensure your `.env` file contains your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

**Pitfalls:**  Forgetting the `@start()` decorator will prevent the flow from initiating.


**Review Prompts:**

* How do you initiate a Flow?
* Describe a simple two-task flow example.




## State Management (Refer to Summary: Flow Output and State, State Management)

Flows manage and share state between different tasks.

**Example:**  A flow might store the generated image URL in the state after the image generation task, making it accessible to subsequent tasks.

**Key Terms:**

* `state`: Attribute of the Flow class for storing state.

**Visual Aid:**

```
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
|   Task 1       |---->| Shared State   |---->|   Task 2       |
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
```

**Study Tip:**  For complex states, structured state management using Pydantic models is recommended.

**Pitfalls:**  Modifying state in parallel tasks without proper synchronization can lead to race conditions.


**Review Prompts:**

* How is state shared between tasks in a Flow?
* What are the benefits of structured state management?




## Event-Driven Architecture (Refer to Summary: Introduction to Flows)

Flows are built on an event-driven model, enabling dynamic and responsive workflows.

**Example:** A task might listen for the completion of multiple other tasks before proceeding.

**Key Terms:**

* Event-driven architecture: A software architecture pattern where actions are triggered by events.

**Study Tip:** Think of each task emitting an event upon completion, which other tasks can listen for.

**Pitfalls:**  Circular dependencies between tasks can lead to deadlocks.


**Review Prompts:**

* What is an event-driven architecture?
* How does this architecture benefit CrewAI Flows?



## Flexible Control Flow (Refer to Summary: Flow Structure and Decorators, Flow Control)

Flows support conditional logic, loops, and branching.

**Example:** Based on the sentiment of a generated text, the flow might choose to either refine the text or proceed to the next step.

**Key Terms:**

* `@listen()`: Decorator marking a listener for a task's output.
* `or_()`:  Listens for the completion of any of the specified methods.
* `and_()`: Listens for the completion of all of the specified methods.
* `@router()`: Decorator for conditional routing based on method output.

**Visual Aid:**

```
       Task 1
        /  \
  or_() |    | and_()
       \  /
       Task 2
```


**Study Tip:** Use `or_()` for scenarios where any of several conditions can trigger the next step, and `and_()` when all conditions must be met.

**Pitfalls:** Overly complex control flow can make the flow difficult to understand and debug.



**Review Prompts:**

* How do you implement conditional logic in a Flow?
* Explain the difference between `or_()` and `and_()`.
* What is the purpose of `@router()`?



## Starting Flows, Listening to Tasks, Flow Output (Refer to Summary: Flow Structure and Decorators, Flow Output and State)

Flows begin with `@start()` decorated methods. `@listen()` connects tasks based on output.  `kickoff()` retrieves the final output.

**Example:**


```python
from crewai import Flow

flow = Flow()

@flow.start()
def task1():
  return "Hello"

@flow.listen(task1)
def task2(task1_output):
    print(task1_output) # Prints "Hello"
    return "World"

print(flow.kickoff()) # Prints "World"

```

**Key Terms:**

* `kickoff()`: Method to start the flow and retrieve the final output.


**Study Tip:** The output of a listened-to method is passed as an argument to the listener function.

**Pitfalls:**  Not retrieving the output using `kickoff()` will result in losing the final result of the flow.


**Review Prompts:**

* How do you start a flow?
* How are tasks connected based on output?
* How do you retrieve the final output of a flow?



## Integrating Crews and Plotting Flows (Refer to Summary: Integrating Crews, Plotting Flows)

Crews are integrated using `crewai create flow <name>`. Flows are visualized using `flow.plot()` or `crewai flow plot`.

**Example:**  Imagine a flow where one crew generates text and another crew summarizes it.

**Key Terms:**

* `crewai create flow`: CLI command to generate a new flow project.
* `plot()`: Method or CLI command to generate a visual plot of a Flow.

**Study Tip:**  Explore the CrewAI examples repository for practical flow examples.

**Pitfalls:**  Incorrectly configuring the crews or the flow can lead to unexpected behavior.  Remember to install dependencies (`crewai install`) and activate your virtual environment (`source .venv/bin/activate`). Run your flows using `crewai flow kickoff` or `uv run kickoff`.


**Review Prompts:**

* How do you integrate existing Crews into a Flow?
* How do you generate a visual representation of a Flow?
